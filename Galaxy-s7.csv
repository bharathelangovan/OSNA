Galaxy-s7,Great phone!,"Upgraded from the S5 and can really tell a difference. It runs smoother and speedier. The battery does not run down near as fast and applications look and run well. The back is a little smoother than I would like, but that was fixed with a slim cover to give more traction when holding or pulling out of my pocjet. Overall, really enjoying this phone!",2017-02-17T21:21:1,jake99

Galaxy-s7,Great phone,This is only my second smart phone. My first was the Galaxy Note II. This is a much faster phone. I did have a problem with the mobile data turning itself off on its own. I turned on developer options and set mobile data to stay on all the time and that fixed it. My only other issue is that I have apps set to update on wifi only and I have to manually update them. They do not update automatically like on my Note II. This might be a Google Play issue though and not a phone issue?,2017-02-14T19:18:2,jab8356

Galaxy-s7,I'm very happy that I decided not to buy an iPhone 7.,"After I bought a Vizio e-series tv, I decided to upgrade my phone, as the Vizio uses apps on the cellphone to control streaming online content. Not only do the two devices function seamlessly together, but compared to my old Samsung Galaxy s3, the s7 is beautiful (the gold-on-platinum finish is so striking, I bought a transparent phone case for it), light, fast, incredibly user-friendly, charges rapidly (less than an hour), and holds a charge throughout a long, busy day. The screen is big without being too big, and for an added bonus, the earbuds included with the phone sound much better than you'd expect, particularly when paired with the Poweramp music player app available on the Google Play Store.",2017-02-08T21:43:4,billybangdouglas

Galaxy-s7,Nice upgrade from s4,"I have been a galaxy fan for years. Had my s4 since that first came out, and I was hesitant  to upgrade since I liked that one so much. This s7 is way better and faster than the s4 and it was exactly what I was hoping for. The ease of moving pictures and numbers over was much easier than anticipated. Personally, I think for the price of the phone it should have included the wireless charger. This phone was more than my rent, which is probably  another reason I was hesitant  to switch, but I needed a new phone and I am glad it was worth the switch.",2017-02-03T04:32:2,Kelsey8183

I am completely satisified with everything the phone has to offer except the battery life. I have to charge it atleast twice a day. Thank goodness for the rapid charge feature.  I really don't feel like I use it as much as others but the battery drains really fast. I'm not a big app user. My biggest use is on facebook while looking at pics. However, even being idle at night, it rapidly drains. I've turned off most of my notifications. too.  Anyway, the size is perfect for me - not too big, not too small. It's got everything I need and more.",2017-01-26T19:47:1,ReneeN

Galaxy-s7,Transitioning from the iOS to the Samsung Galaxy s7 was much easier than I initially expected it to be.,"This is an amazing phone. First and foremost I love the customizability of it. It's quite literally a personal companion down to the nitty gritty. Transferring information from the iOS was easy too. Unlike iTunes, Samsung is made to be a compatible devise per each individual user. I love this phone. Obviously being waterproof is an outstanding perk. I used to think the battery life of the iOS was something to be proud of, but the galaxy s7 has a tremendous battery life and charges 100% faster. That helps so you don't go to bed with your phone plugged in and when it's done charging it doesn't just continually burn up the battery. You charge it as its needed and that's that. So far I have yet to find anything I dislike about the Samsung Galaxy s7. Highly recommend this phone.",2017-01-14T18:17:5,GoGalaxybyBeefy

Galaxy-s7,I Love My Phone!,"I got my phone a couple of months ago after upgrading from the Galaxy S5 and have no problems with it. I can go a whole day without charging until night time and then there are days I do have to charge during the day. It all depends on how I use my phone. I have a lot of apps that was transferred from the Galaxy  S5 but haven't activate all of them. If I had activated all of them, then I would be charging my phone twice or more a day.  BTW  I like the new style charger because the the hardly feels hot to the touch.\r\n\r\nI do have minor complaints.\r\n1- Not happy with a removable battery. It was the only I could shut off my other phones when they froze. This phone hasn't frozen so far.\r\n2- Being made of glass. More of a risk of being cracked. That was one of the reasons why I didn't want the iPhone.\r\n3- Needs sensitivity touch control when wearing gloves in the winter which they had on the Galaxy S5.\r\n4- Needs voice commands when using a Bluetooth when driving. I had that command when I had a flip phone (I forgot which cell phone company had that. All I had to do was press the button on my Bluetooth and the voice commands came on.) so why can't a smart phone have it without going to the PlayStore and downloading Google Voice? It should be automatically programmed into the phone just like my old flip phone?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I am very happy with the phone. It is very easy to use and Verizonwireless customer service is very helpful when I am in a jam.",2017-01-12T15:49:1,beedee11126
Galaxy-s7,I love my new phone!,Just switched from an iPhone 5c because of all the things I don't like about Apple. Wanted to give Android a try. I'm so glad that I did. I find it so much more user friendly and I'm really happy with it!,2017-01-12T00:35:4,Emma Jane
Galaxy-s7,Great features,Absolutely love the color of my Galaxy S7 Edge and the size is perfect The transition from one phone to the next is very simple and easy to manipulate around,2017-01-12T00:22:3,Loop83
Galaxy-s7,Definitely an improvment over my S4.,"The S7 is what I wanted when I bought my old S4!\r\n\r\nThere are several advantages over my old S4. The responsiveness is vastly improved. The extra memory (32G vs 16G) allows for many more apps. I had hit the limit with the S4. The camera works the way that you would expect a good one to work. The one in the S4 was more often than not a disappointment. The S7 camera focuses nearly instantaneously and can be set to track and stay focused on the object (person, hawk flying, etc.). The delay in the S4 was always frustrating and it would often re-focus on the wrong object in the frame.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be aware of is the need for a good protective cover. The phone is slippery! I purchased a Spigen cover with a protective plastic edge that both looks great and is functional. It does not cover the side buttons. I might switch to one like I had on the S4 that does cover the buttons because it is too easy to accidentally press the power button on the side and wake the phone, but that's in the personal preference area. The cover should have a ridge above the screen because on the S7 the glass sits proud of the edge, exposed in a drop.\r\n\r\nThe battery life is much better than it is in the S4 as well.\r\n\r\nI can say that I haven't found anything negative to report on the S7 itself. I wouldn't have any other.",2017-01-11T22:47:4,dlr77

Galaxy-s7,Great phone!,Coming from Motorola phones this was a huge performance increase. My old Droid was touted as the best battery lasting device. I was lucky to go 10 hours even when new. This S7 puts that Motorola to shame along either a better camera that doesn't hesitate when snapping a shot.

Galaxy-s7,Love the Galaxy S7!,"I upgraded to the Galaxy S7 from the Galaxy S5. So far it is working better than my previous phone regarding speed and a few more features.I love the increased access to my most used apps on my home page. Previously the app icon access was limited requiring scroll to other pages to find apps. I haven't had time to explore much of it's capability or the picture quality yet but hope too soon. I love the notifications, time, date and battery display with the Always on Display feature without unlocking the phone. The Smart Switch app (and the Verizon rep) made it easy to transfer the old data/apps from my previous phone to the S7. Also love that unsaved callers are identified now with calls. Will make it easier to avoid/block telemarketer calls and to add new friends to my contacts. The option for 2 apps on the Lock screen is also great. I love that the Verizon apps and the Samsung apps are organized into separate files and not with the rest of the apps - makes it easier to find. The only negative thing is the sensitivity of the screen/key board is not quite as good as my last phone. I often have to repeatedly press the screen to finish a text. I have been very pleased with my Samsung phones and will likely continue with this product line.",2016-12-08T16:29:2,Beth in VA

Getting apps set up was easy, and responsiveness is very good. Battery life is also much better than the S5, and it doesn't have the clunky flap to open the USB charging slot. The only problem I have encountered is that often the fingerprint scanner doesn't pick up my fingerprint swipe, and I end up having to enter the password.",2016-11-30T20:45:3,baseball bob

Galaxy-s7,S7 vs Pixel,"I bought this 2 weeks ago after returning my Pixel. The images in Pixel are poor compared to the S7. Pictures taken in low light were grainy. Zoom is very limited, could only zoom to half of screen size vs S7 which is full screen and more. Just got back from WY and the S7 pics are all amazing! It has so many options to adjust for any light level. Easy to use. The phone is fantastic. I have an S5 before this. My only regret is that the camera had 16mp like my S5, not 12mp. \r\nI am so glad to have returned the Pixel. Samsung has done it again!",2016-11-02T12:27:5,Dmb5

I do lose my play lists in the Amazon media player when I restart the phone. \r\n\r\nI did have trouble with ordering. I went online to order for in store pickup. The order got stuck in the system. Five hours later, I had to visit the store to get the order released. Very frustrating.\r\n\r\nI took the phone home to activate it. I live in a dead zone. I was told, by an employee, that only a good Wi-Fi signal was needed to activate. That is wrong. I had to return to the store to get it activated. Very frustrating. \r\n\r\nThe in store manager was helpful, professional and great help. She made sure I walked away completely satisfied. \r\n\r\nThe lesson I learned was ALWAYS activate at the store.",2016-11-01T18:57:1,None of the above

Galaxy-s7,Great improvement over the former Galaxy S5,"I have been using the S7 for about a week now, and I'm quite happy with it.\r\nThe camera is WAY improved.  Better focus and quicker pictures, even in lower light conditions.  Make sure you get an SD card for the storage, as the increased resolution could eat up your memory quick.\r\nSpeaking of SD storage, access to the SD is improved, with storage outside of the battery compartment, sharing space with the SIM card.\r\nAudio is improved - louder and seems better directed towards the user.\r\nThe interface itself is nicer.  Samsung didn't go messing with the menus and locations too much, so previous Galaxy users won't get frustrated from thumb memory.\r\nAnd to be expected, performance from the better chipset is great.\r\nOh yeah, voice calling does seem better, even in my home's reception blackhole.\r\nThey also scooted the power button down a bit, making it easier to reach with the thumb.",2016-10-02T14:01:3,houston tx

Galaxy-s7,Yet another great Galaxy!,"So far, only having this Galaxy S7 a week, I'm very happy with it! Yes, I've had to install the video player app since they've inexplicably not included it, but that's not a big deal. I love the inclusion of a graphic equalizer, the improved camera, and the new ability to plug-in a flash drive with the included adapter. I wish they had kept the removable battery layout. The so-called rapid charger is not rapid at all, taking roughly the same amount of time to charge as my old Galaxy S5, and as with the S5, it gets uncomfortably hot during charging, updating, or shooting long videos. I'm glad that they kept the micro SD card option, as it's a deal-maker for me. I would definitely recommend this phone!

Galaxy-s7,Awesome phone with little complaint,"I had a Galaxy S4 for 2 years and loved it, and was worried about upgrading, because my husband has an S5 and it's terrible.  I had no need to worry though!  The S7 is amazing!  Very fast and easy to use.  They have made improvements over the prior phones.  Only a couple of down sides: 1. Back is glass, which I did not know and got a crack in it the very first day. Lesson - don't use a cheap case. 2. They need to figure out how to make better glass add in screens that fit the whole screen without having the edges come un-stuck. \r\n3. You can not currently adjust screen sensitivity and this is really not cool. How do you forget to add that as a feature?\r\nI'm nit picking, but trying to be honest. Overall, I'm very pleased with my new phone and would recommend it!!!",2016-08-24T19:14:3,AmbrosiaJ

Galaxy-s7,Amazing Phone,"Bought this phone about three months ago and I can say that I LOVE it!  The Snapdragon 820 processor is amazingly quick.  Camera is by far the best out of the box. If you decide to learn more about the camera options, you can fine tune the phone to match a professional camera.  A 3,000 mAh battery is incredible.  I'm a moderate to heavy user of the phone and I can say that it does me well for a daily driver.  Generally I'm left with about 35% at the end of the day at 10 PM. The water proofing is also amazing!  I've submerged it in a glass of water for about 25ish minutes and it works just fine.  There have been occasions where I've even taken it to a pool to shoot some video and pictures and nothing bad happened.  Just make sure you don't leave it in the pool for more than 30 minutes just for safe keeping.  The body is extremely easy to hold and all buttons are easily accessible. Some extra perks are the fingerprint scanner, super high resolution screen and the wireless charging capabilities! So far I LOVE this phone and this is after six years of iPhone usage.  Best phone on the market and I'll recommend this phone to ANYONE!  Good job, Samsung ;)",2016-08-17T23:50:2,DTrick

The new functionality (for us anyway) that we are using is great. Using the functionality id not intuitive though. Just downloaded the User Guide to sync the phone with a vehicle's Bluetooth.

Galaxy-s7,So much better than the iPhone,"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my time as abVerizon iPhone user. But, as someone who truly believes these gadgets are meant to simplify life, I found that the iPhone was making mine more complicated. You see, I am a PC user and trying to seamlessly sync my iPhone with my MS Outlook Calendar and Contacts was a constant nightmare. During syncs, contact info would get scrambled. And I hated the fact that iTunes counted how many times I played a song, etc. I also couldn't stand how they controlled my data storage on the device. The Samsung Galaxy S7 really allows me to control my experience- Even the camera is awesome! For very little money, I picked up a SIM card and am now able to really take all of my music and pictures with me without taxing the phone's internal storage. This is the smart phone experience I have been waiting for!",2016-08-01T20:39:4,HappySamsung7User

Galaxy-s7,great phone. just a little slippery without a case!,"I've had this phone for a week now, and am enjoying it. although without a case it is a little hard to hold onto without tapping the sides of the screen, and it is slimmer and rounder than my s5. no worries since i'll be buying a case for it. love the double tap on the home button to quick open the camera, love the removable hidden storage. Samsung included everything you needed to transfer everything from your old phone to this one, and included the tool to open the hidden sd slot. the camera has a pro mode and allows you to shoot in RAW which is wonderful for when I forget my camera at home.",2016-07-28T19:24:0,evoashh

Galaxy-s7,Still getting the settings the way I like them.,The phone is a big improvement from the S5.  The Android settings are a challenge to get all working the way I would like.  I think some of the explanations of the settings could be written in better language so all could understand them.  A terms dictionary might help.  When I was was working my company gave us a course in writing so all audiences could understand what you were writing in plain language.  That is what is needed here.,2016-07-28T18:25:1,Yussel

Galaxy-s7,Really Nice Phone,"I have the 32GB Black Onyx S7. Previously I had the S6 Edge and both are seamless in terms of performance and design. One of the many features of the S7 thats better than the S6 model if it's expandable memory, which I love since I download a lot of videos, take videos, and take pictures. Another thing is the response time of the touch sensors, despite when using it underwater where in you can mostly just take pictures and such. All the same its an amazing phone and durable too! I'd recommend it to any of my friends, unfortunately they are Apple people so I couldn't convince them otherwise. In all though, and in my opinion it is the best model and company out there among the top smart phone companies.",2016-07-26T20:39:5,Kurona

Also a strangely off feature I love is the HD voice feature when talking to someone with the same option on their phone...it sounds like they are right beside you.

Video game, YouTube News outlets in 4K robust color. Speed like you wouldn't believe. The photo quality in low light is unsurpassed even by some SLR cameras. This phone does it all and more.

Galaxy-s7,Another great Samsung phone,"So far I'm loving this phone, I've had it a week now and have played with a lot of the settings and features. My previous phone was a Samsung S4 Mini and I really liked it so I knew my next phone was going to be a Samsung as well. I'm a big fan of the S Health app which has a heart rate monitor, has an optional alert that will bug you if you sit too long, and will link up with other apps like Nike + Running. The heart rate monitor is on the back next to the camera, you just press your finger to it and it records your heart rate. You can then tell it what you were doing at that time: resting, after exercise, before exercise, etc. The camera is fantastic, the standby battery life is pretty decent, screen is a great size neither too big nor too small, screen resolution is amazing. And unlike the S6 this one does have a micro SD slot which was very important to me since I had one in my previous phone and wanted to swap it to the new one. Overall, great device with fun features and I'm enjoying it thus far.",2016-07-22T14:29:5,ceb111481

Galaxy-s7,Expensive but worth it,"Just upgraded from my old Galaxy S3 which is obviously a big step and I'm really happy with the S7. Some of the settings were hard to find at first and aren't very intuitive but there's some good articles online that unpack all of the different settings you can adjust and how to find them. Camera is great even with the zoom when the zoom was basically unusable on the S3 because it got so blurry. Processing speeds are great, haven't had any glitches, delays, or freezes at all. Battery life is splendid so far, I've been going a day and a half without charging it and don't need to turn on power saving mode or turn off data/wifi to conserve battery. The speed charging function is also really cool, charging overnight is just overkill it takes less than 2 hours for a full charge. In the end it was more expensive than I would've liked but is a great product and hopefully it continues to be worth the price!",2016-07-08T15:20:4,phoneuser9123534756674

Her phone had to be replaced once and both gave her fits the whole two years.  Upgrading us both to the S7, which we have had now for just over a week, was a very smart thing to do.  Both phones are working great.

Galaxy-s7,Outstanding phone!,"I've had my S7 just over a week and couldn't be happier with it!  I upgraded from an HTC One M8 which was a great phone all its own for some time.  But after experiencing excessive lagging, random freezes and app hangs, and degradation of the touch screen from normal wear and tear over the past 18 mos, I decided to upgrade.  After much research, both online and in talking to friends and co-workers who'd recently purchased new phones (both Android and Apple), I decided on the Galaxy S7.  The screen is bold and bright, it handles every app I've loaded with nary a hiccup, it's compatible with my existing chargers and cords, and the wireless charging is a great feature.  Oh, and it also survived TWO unplanned and unintended drops onto pavement prior to purchasing a protective case for it!  :)",2016-06-28T19:27:2,SoCalBoiler

Galaxy-s7,I love this phone!!,"First of all, selfies is what's in and I the the face front camera (I call it the selfie camera, lol). Front and back camera is clear as ever! The battery life is really long lasting and trust me I am ALWAYS on my phone. I upgraded from my S5 because the the S7 has a better camera and because the S7 is water resistant like the S5. I did not upgrade to the S6 because it was not water resistant  (yes, that matters). I'm enjoying every bit of this phone and it's in my favorite color, GOLD!!",2016-05-24T23:11:0,Janiqua
Galaxy-s7,Greaty Improvements,"I bought this as an upgrade from the S4.  The sound quality is magnificent compared to my old phone.  My wife LOVES the video chat feature that comes standard.  It reacts quickly, doesn't feel like a small tablet (only a hair larger than the S4), and is water resistant (haven't tested that yet, but my phones have a tendency to go swimming so that was a plus out of the gate).",2016-05-24T23:06:0,DaPatriot

Galaxy-s7,"Great phone, stop preloading it with garbage.","So I've noticed that all my Verizon smartphones have included gradually more and more preloaded apps that are worthless. It's the reason that older generations of people generally feel intimidated by the smartphone experience, they are overwhelmed by all the garbage icons that they see. \r\n\r\nSo how about this: instead of making it a ritual where I have to manually hide or uninstall all these useless apps before my mom can use her new phone, you just don't include it. Then she can download her own apps and not feel exasperated that she doesn't know what Milk Music is or why she continually needs to download updates for it.",2016-05-24T18:22:3,Sarabeth

Galaxy-s7,Very easy to use!,"I'm impressed with this phone, granted I upgraded from a much older, very slow smart phone.  I really like the fingerprint unlock feature as it works very quickly when I need to access the phone.  This phone runs very fast and efficiently and pairs extremely well with bluetooth devices. I experienced my first HD phone call on it yesterday was quite please with the call quality.  I am enjoying it.\r\nRecommendation: In many reviews, people talk about the back of it getting smudged with fingerprints very easily.  This is true.  I recommend getting a good cover for it.  The one I got from Seidio is very well done and still allows the phone to be thin enough easily fit in my pocket.  A cover also makes it easier to hold.",2016-05-18T13:32:1,Pelsa

The best part is I can customize many things. I can change the theme, size of the keyboard, size of the screen, etc. And the phone itself is pretty, so i just got a clear phone case. I didn't check the waterproof because i'm afraid it might work. But I really like my phone. And my friend got this phone too after using mine for a day.",2016-05-04T19:32:5,shcho91

Galaxy-s7,Was an easy transition from the S6 to the S7.,I've only had the phone for a week or so and so far so good! Still learning new features and experimenting with the awesome camera! The only problem I'm having is getting the text message alert and the default notifications working properly.,2016-05-04T04:42:5,Catrina456
Galaxy-s7,Well worth the wait.,"I finally upgraded from my S4 as I could no longer take the phone refusing to reconnect to cell towers after losing a signal without rebooting, 6 hour battery life adn the constant disconnect from my car's bluetooth. I've had the S7 for over a week now. The battery lasts me over 2 days! I just can't believe it. Granted my usage may be low, but my previous phone didn't even last a full working day. Perhaps I shouldn't be so impressed, maybe the S7 is just working as it should where my S4 didn't work properly from the get go. Pictures are clear, I like some of the new gadets, but miss some too (flashlight icon to put on homescreen). The fingerprint sensor works shockingly well (I was very skeptical based on previous experience with bad biometric hardware). I am glad Samsung replaced the removable SD card, but wonder WHY they don't allow it to act as seemless storage (it's only good for storing videos and photos, it doesn't act like seemless internal storage - read cnet and other reviews). The build quality is fantastic although the slight beveling on the front screen does cause most tempered glass protectors to look like they have bubbles around the edges.",2016-05-03T01:50:0,bowgross
Galaxy-s7,The Galaxy S7 exceeded my expections.,"From the time I started using the Galaxy S7 I knew I made the right choice. From it's quality construction, to it's fast performance, I knew I made the right choice switching from my previous Galaxy S6.\n1. The camera- wonderful images crisp quality with great resolution and accurate color rendering.\n2. The bright, clear screen is viewable in all sorts of light, inside and out.\n3. The battery life is definitely a plus with plenty of full day use.\n4. The advantage of a SD card for storing media, photos, videos and music is a definitely plus.\nFinally, it is a phone, and when I make calls they go through consistently and the conversations are clear with no unwanted digital or analog noises.\nSo, if you are looking for a great new phone I recommend the Galaxy S7 to anyone in the market or looking for a replacement to their current phone.",2016-05-01T19:00:3,HBR3
Galaxy-s7,Please that I decided to upgrade early despite the cost.,"I very pleased I decided to upgrade very early despite the cost. My primary reason for upgrading early in my contract was the expandable memory the Galaxy S7 has that the Galaxy S6 does not have. I am very pleased with the features/advanced features the Galaxy S7 has compared to the S6. A more advanced camera system, much more memory capability, a battery that lasts longer, clearer pictures and a more advanced system than the S6.",2016-04-30T20:49:5,livieR
Galaxy-s7,Great Phone,"I recently upgraded to the s7 from a RazorM. Yes, it was a huge upgrade. I've read all of the 'complaints' from other users, but I have not experienced any of them. The phone is working great. The battery life is lasting for days, the network and wifi connections have been continuous. Granted, I'm not glued to my phone like most folks, which might be why my battery lasts so much longer, but my old phone would die just sitting on my desk. So this is a big improvement. It also charges super fast.",2016-04-30T19:09:2,bzryan

This phone however blows that one into oblivion. It's like going from roller skates into a sports car. I can honestly say I haven't had any issues with the phone's app performance. The camera is amazing. It focuses so fast and it the pics are so beautifully sharp. I feel this phone is almost perfect and it's making me kind of arrogant because it's so awesome I keep telling people about it without them even asking!\nAlso, I used to think what's the big deal about cellphones. They all do the same things and basically look the same. That was my mindset until I started using this baby. I feel like I'm holding a long lost treasure. I have the gold version and I love looking at it let alone using it. It's kind of hypnotic.\nI said earlier that this phone is almost perfect, because the main thing that it is supposed to do which is phone calls, is definitely lacking. I have had multiple people tell me that they couldn't hear me very well and that I was cutting in and out but I could hear them just fine. That really irks me because I like smartphones but I believe above all else any phone should not have major issues with calls. Instead this phone is like an awesome portable computer with a poorly working phone built into it.\nI still gave it 5 stars because I think that the call quality is not a deal breaker considering how amazing everything else about the phone is. Also it's totally possible that the reception is an issue from Verizon where I live rather than the phone itself. For me the S7 lives up to the hype!",2016-04-28T20:01:4,mikey0825

Galaxy-s7,"So far, so great","I went from the S4 to the Note 5 to the S7. I am very happy with this phone so far. The screen is incredible, and so is the camera. The SD card slot is great and very useful. So far, I have had no trouble with it. I get a strong signal on 4G, wifi, bluetooth. Voice calls have been solid in both directions. As for the battery life, I'm not having the terrible experience that I see others reporting. I'd suggest going through your settings and tweaking a few things to improve battery life. There are quite a few good articles that come up in a Google search that will help.",2016-04-27T19:55:3,Mahoogalies
Galaxy-s7,Samsung Galaxy S7,"I am very pleased with my new phone. I previously had an IPhone5 and was not at all pleased with it. I am big on the swipe feature for texting and the IPhone didn't allow that.\n\nAlso, the camera on this new phone is amazing. In love with the pictures it takes. Will never go back to an IPhone again.",2016-04-27T18:24:1,Lulu1267
Galaxy-s7,Great phone!,"I should qualify this review by saying that for 2+ years I was using the Samsung Stratosphere II, so this phone seems very high tech in comparison (and this is a BRAND new phone for me, so take this review with a grain of salt)! It has LOTS of features, it's fast, and the battery life is really long. I also like that the screen is not TOO big. Some of the notifications are different from my last phone, so I'll need to see how I can change that; if you're not really into technology like me, you may need help setting up certain parts of this phone.",2016-04-26T18:54:5,KEArion

Galaxy-s7,Most powerful phone on the market,"Absolutely love this phone. Have had no issues with any features of it. Battery is reliable and with the fast charging, takes about an hour to go from 0-100%. Camera quality is amazing, processing speed is lightning fast. All and all the besst phone i've ever had",2016-04-26T12:06:3,derrick_vand27
Galaxy-s7,Back to a Galaxy again,"I originally wanted the s7 for the larger battery, SD card slot and water resistance. The phone has all day battery and I'm not jumping to go dunk my phone in the water. Double tap the home button and the camera is off and going fast. Fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast although I don't really use it except to verify a purchase. If Touch Wiz isn't your thing, it's incredibly easy to load keyboards, launchers, that are more to your liking (I prefer Google keyboard and voice to text it comes with). The things that Samsung offers with this keyboard really change the look of the phone. There are several free options to choose from or you can buy one to your liking. Wireless charging is another win, charging my phone through an Otterbox Defender case. Fast charging with the stock charger works and charges more quickly than wireless (I used my old Verizon tilt charger from my last phone rather than buy a Samsung fast wireless charger). If you have a bunch of mini USB/wireless charging accessories, they should all work with this phone which is actually another reason I picked the s7. Call quality through Bluetooth and with the phone itself is excellent. Samsung Milk Music is worth the nominal monthly fee for no ads, no DJ, and the ability to stream music without burning up internet, it does it offline through the app. Gaming is good, I've heard people comment about covering the speaker but I've had no problems whatsoever. There is a dedicated gaming app that allows you to block notifications, record and share your gaming experience if that's your thing. Speaker is clear and sounds like what a single cellphone speaker should, no issues with speakerphone, but don't expect stereo quality. Overall I'm really happy with the smaller form factor even being at bifocal age coming from a Nexus 6 with a 6\",2016-04-26T09:41:4,qwerty069

Galaxy-s7,Very Well Designed Phone,"Up to now, the only thing the Iphone had that was better than Android was the build quality of the phone. The S7 changes that. It surpasses the quality of the Iphone, plus Touchwiz is much lighter and less intrusive. It actually focuses on useful tweaks and additions to Android. It's a pleasure to use.

I love that I can reach my kids in places that our dumb phones didn't have reception. Love all the apps too! I have not had problems with the battery life, but I charge it every night and it lasts all day. For my family that can't seem to stop playing with them, they have to charge during the day sometimes.

However, when you turned those on, you couldn't talk and email/text/use the GPS at the same time. Everything is all fixed with the S7! Battery life is back, all the features work again, and his phone is faster than my S5 - which makes him happy having the superior phone :) Boys with toys.",2016-04-08T01:59:2,amy0711

Galaxy-s7,Switched to S7 from iPhone and so glad that I did.,"I got this phone 10 days ago, and I absolutely love it. I decided to go with something other than my iPhone, as I wanted expandable storage. (I had a few other gripes about the iPhone that I won't get into). I was a little reluctant to try Android, as I was afraid that it would be less user-friendly. After about one day of using it, I was hooked on this phone.\n\nPros:\n\n-- Beautiful screen with vivid colors\n-- Size is about perfect for me. I don't want anything bigger.\n-- It's really fast. Apps open and run very quickly. Fingerprint recognition is really fast.\n-- I could write a ton on ease of use. It's very easy to navigate and do stuff. In my opinion, even easier than an iPhone. I love the ability to close all Apps at once by clicking a single button. It's so easy to transfer files (such as music) from your PC by just clicking and dragging. Bye-bye iTunes and all it's issues!\n-- Battery life is about the same as an iPhone, based on my usage profile. You can get a full day's worth of use without recharging if you aren't on it constantly, and/or playing games.\n-- You can get a lot of extra battery life by activating Power Save Mode.\n-- Charges in about 1 hour and 15 minutes with fast charger.\n-- Camera is awesome.\n\nCons:\n\n-- No easy way to sync with Outlook for contacts. There are some 3rd party apps that do this, but they aren't as good as iTunes.\n-- Slow motion video camera doesn't allow you to zoom. Kind of a bummer if your are doing sports video.",2016-04-05T19:05:2,Stew67
Galaxy-s7,S4 to S7,"I've been eligible for upgrade since last year, but I waited specifically for this phone because I knew it'd be worth it! Though I'm still disappointed Samsung made the decision not to release a white colored phone here in the US (as it's personally my favorite color), I'm really loving the gold color and how it changes tone in different lighting! The fingerprint visibility is unfortunately very high, but it isn't a deal breaker. The phone itself is great and an incredible upgrade from the S4 (which I have loved dearly over these last two years); the size is only an inch bigger and it's more narrow than the S4, which is a plus for someone with small hands like me! The battery life is SUCH an upgrade from the S4, and though I don't think it's quite as good as advertised and reviewed, it's still fantastic. The longest I've gone without a charge (and I haven't even let it fully die yet) is well over 8 hours, and even then it was only down to 15% with extremely heavy use. The camera on this phone is fantastic, too; I have no idea what the S6 camera was like, but the S4 was far from cutting edge. I spent a day taking pictures in various lighting and every single one has turned out great! I'm also extremely glad that expandable storage is back because it's a necessity these days. My only complaint is that I did not receive an SD Card Tray Removal Tool with my phone like I was supposed to, and since I live in a dorm with significantly less things around than I would have had at home, I ended up having to unbend a staple to get it open. The phone is fantastic, and the fast charger included is REALLY fast - it literally charges my phone 10% in five minutes. I haven't tested the extent of water resistance yet, but one of my friends got the phone as well and was bold enough to pour a cup of water over it with no damage whatsoever, so it looks like it's well done! I really, really adore this phone. Another great Samsung product!",2016-04-05T19:00:5,armyash13

Galaxy-s7,Fast UI and great screen,Best phone on the market for 2016!,2016-04-04T01:35:2,Thanigatyrone
Galaxy-s7,The S7 is an awesome phone.,"I've had this phone for a little over 2 weeks. It has not disappointed at all. It is the perfect size, charges quickly and has great battery life (much better than my S5 by comparison). It is fast and has lots of room for apps. I debated between this model and the Edge and I made the right decision for me.",2016-04-04T00:50:2,fridayschild25
Galaxy-s7,Great all around phone,Bought this phone a week ago after I dropped the S5 I've had for two years in soup. I love the phone so far and all the new features they've added since the 5. The only thing I don't like so far is I had to use Ultra power saving mode yesterday and the message app kept glitching out and blacking out the screen & my brothers s7 did the same thing today,2016-04-03T22:35:0,Sharroun552
Galaxy-s7,Love This Phone!,I bought this phone when it became avaliable for pre-order and I have absolutely love it. I believe the Samsung Galaxy Series is the best Android phone out there. I love that they listened to the public and bought back the SD card slot with the ability to have up to 200GB of additional space. I am also amazed with the camera especially since they went down in pixels from the S6. The speed of the phone is excellent as is the battery life and the ability for the phone to keep cool to the touch with new cooling core they used. I especially love that they were able to do all this while keeping the cool sleek design of the S6. I definitely recommend this phone A+ all the way.,2016-04-03T20:24:2,VB2016
Galaxy-s7,Great price for a quality product.,I bought one for myself and my teenage daughter. She absolutely loves her phone. The camera is the best feature. It takes absolutely gorgeous pictures.,2016-04-03T19:06:2,Black Beauty 225

Galaxy-s7,Good phone,"I bought this phone a week ago and have enjoyed it the whole time. I have enjoyed the S5, S6, and S7 now. The battery will last all day with Web surfing, phone calls and gaming. Charges quickly as well. After the day at work I have a 35 minute drive. Charging it on the way home puts it at 100% by the end of the drive while still leaving the phone on. New features on this phone from the S6 that I am enjoying are video chat with my girlfriend who also has an S7. The pictures are just magnificent. Even the pics from the front camera are crystal clear. Just all around happy with the phone.",2016-03-31T19:03:3,Ajonesy22

Galaxy-s7,"It's early, but...","I got this phone the day it came out. I am a Samsung fan. first off, the camera is amazing. My son recwntly got his temps and he was driving down the road and I sneezes a pic of him. The houses in the background are crystal clear going 40mph. Also the slow motion video has sound. Function and ease of use are like other galaxy phones. Only knock I have is that I was hoping the bartery would last longer. It is good, but not great.",2016-03-31T13:48:4,Tim b
Galaxy-s7,Never thought I'd like it better than my iPhone,"I've had iPhones for the last 5 years, I NEVER thought I'd like anything else! Even the older galaxy's, I wasn't a fan of. I have another phone line, and it needed a phone on it, so I decided to try this one! And I LOVE it! So much so, that I've decided to switch the galaxy s7, to my main line, and use my iPhone 6s Plus, on my other. The battery definitely doesn't last near as long as advertised, but it does charge SUPER fast. I let both my iPhone and the Galaxy get to the same battery percentage, hooked them both up, and the Galaxy charged almost twice as fast. The pictures are incredible, crisp and clear, even when my 2 year old is moving around, dancing, being silly, it captures that moment without it being blurry! And I LOVE that you can add more storage just with an SD card! I take tons and tons of pictures(I have almost 9,000 on my iPhone) so it's a big deal for me! And even though the screen is substantially smaller than my iPhone, it's still amazing! I also love the keyboard, when you click on symbols, even when you press space, it doesn't go back to letters, which is something I've always hated with the iPhone.\nI don't think I'll switch my main line back to the iPhone!",2016-03-31T05:43:4,Shaerae91
Galaxy-s7,Best phone I have ever had!,I pre-ordered the S7. And I have never been happier since I got it,2016-03-31T03:04:1,Nisus
Galaxy-s7,Gloves do not fit this good!,Went from an S3 to the S7 excellent choice for me,2016-03-31T02:36:2,mycole
Galaxy-s7,Samsung nailed it this time!,Had the phone 2 weeks now and it works great. Battery lasts almost 2 days on a charge. WiFi connects great and the speed of fingerprint recognition is amazing. Going back to the micro SD slot was a fantastic response by Samsung to customer feedback. The waterproof capability is a real comfort though I hope never.to need it. Now if Samsung will adopt the shatterproof screen... The camera is amazing. Overall 5 stars. Congrats Samsung. Job well done.,2016-03-31T00:45:1,Snakeman81
Galaxy-s7,Best phone I've owned yet!,Verizon has always been the best of phone companies out of all of them out there. I upgraded from the s5 to the s7 and it was a very easy transaction and the phone is amazing! Awesome core processor and the amazing camera quality are just of the few next generation phone qualities that has started with the s7 and is still to come!,2016-03-30T23:08:5,evanscfa18
Galaxy-s7,From Windows to Android,"I bought this phone to assure compatibility with my G2 smart watch. Although it has only been just a couple of weeks, I am glad I did. The watch and phone are seamless in functioning together. Both are extremely intuitive, and the G2 is simply awesome. It does everything flawlessly. I am not a power user when it comes to games, so I have not feedback on down loading various apps. Both used for business and personal communications. No complaints so far.",2016-03-30T21:49:4,John0618
Galaxy-s7,Enjoying It,"I've had my Galaxy S7 (I only get the odd number Galaxy devices) since the day it was made available on American markets and am thoroughly enjoying it.\nI like the heavier, more solid feel to it. However, with the device enveloped in glass, I was afraid I would drop it and break it for about 8 days until I got an Otter Box.\nFast, fluid movement. Clear, bright display. Camera is what I'd hoped it would be.\nBattery life, however is a major disappointment. Thankfully, the fast charging cord is pretty impressive. Moving my apps from device storage to SD storage is a little bit more laborious, but I'm glad that it is still an option.\nS Voice is much more responsive. I'm finding it very useful.\nI only want my contacts automatically saved to Verizon Cloud, nothing else. I'm frustrated that I can not find that option.\nThe ear buds are ridiculous. They are awkward shaped, don't fit, don't stay in and are uncomfortable. Great sound if you can make them stay in.",2016-03-30T20:59:2,Sky_Mex
Galaxy-s7,Amazing Phone so Far,"Camera is great. Screen and the visuals are amazing. Touchwiz is better. Phone is very responsive. Fingerprint scanner works well. Have 4 fingers programed in which is the max amount. I had the Galaxy 3 so this is a huge bump up in everything possible. Samsung continues to do a great job improving their phones. Huge plus is the Micro SD slot back. I got the 128GB to hold all my music, pictures, and you can put your apps on it as well if you want. Only been almost 3 weeks having it and I have no complaints. Only exception would be the battery life seems to drain if you're on it with hard use. Usually go to sleep with about 90% battery and not charging it throughout the day I get to about 25%. So not terrible and that's with moderate usage in spurts. Started my day today at 84% at 6AM and its now almost 5pm and I am at 15% and that was again with moderate usage. Wi-Fi Turned off, Bluetooth turned off and Location turned off as well.\n\nAll in all top of the line phone and so happy I got this. Just waiting on my Gear S2 since I pre-ordered the phone.",2016-03-30T20:54:3,Buddy1320
Galaxy-s7,"Awesome, Awesome","I've had it for over a week now.

So many great features!",2016-03-30T20:44:1,Steve11flhtc

Galaxy-s7,Wonderful Phone,"I bought this phone after finding it the most familiar when comparing to the big three flagships right now. 6P,LG5,G7. Loving it. Brilliant screen responsive and incredibly tactile almost too much. Battery life is great if you do the defaults (turn down brightness etc) great phone right out of the box would reccomend",2016-03-30T19:38:5,Iamthemurray
Galaxy-s7,What I've been waiting for,"Had the Galaxy 5 and loved it but the 16 gigs of internal storage was becoming annoying. Waited for the S7 and very glad I did. 32 is always better than 16, even with the SD card. It is fast and the display is gorgeous. Love the always-on feature especially since I use it as a bedside clock. No need to wake it up to tell me the time. I got the gold case and it is beautiful. Having read reviews I immediately added a glass screen protector and a clear case that keeps the beauty of the phone. Haven't taken many photos yet but the few I have are very good.",2016-03-30T18:30:5,JKAZ
Galaxy-s7,New to the S Family,"I purchase the S7 as an upgrade from my Note 3. I thought I was going to miss the huge Note screen and the S pen but the fact I can add extra storage is the best thing ever. I now use the Message app instead of the text message that's standard and I love the VW Message app. But all in all I don't really miss the Note or the S Pen. The phone is fun and sleek. I have not tried the water test, as I tend not put my phone in water but if my hands are wet I am not worried if I need to answer a call. I do miss the feature that allows me to wave my hand over the phone and answer the call but that's just one feature.",2016-03-30T17:36:3,ZapJ

Galaxy-s7,Upgraded from a S3 to S7,"I have had the S7 for three weeks now and absolutely glad I upgraded from the S3. It took some setting up however it was worth the time. This model is light and slim. I went with the wireless charger and have had no problems with it. There are so many ways to set up your phone, you may get confused at first however settings are easy to change. The only complaint is the battery life is not long and you have to make sure the background light is turned down to preserve the battery life and applications are not running all the time. The battery will last all day for the most part.",2016-03-30T11:56:2,Cld022

Battery life adequate. (I wish I had known that the Edge version has a larger battery; that might have made me upgrade to that.) I haven't tested out its water resistance, nor the SD Card option, but I am glad those features are there.\nI really appreciated the smooth upgrade from the S4: I had the Verizon folks do the move for me, and everything moved: logons to WiFi hotspots, text message exchanges, etc. (OK, a couple of games reset back to level 1. I can deal with that.)\nBest of all, of course, is that I now have room for ALL my apps in main memory!",2016-03-29T23:47:0,AskThatNiceMan

Galaxy-s7,Only minor gripes,"I only really have two minor gripes with the phone to this point. The first is that it can sometimes be a little too sensitive and opens links when I am merely scrolling through. The other is the placement of the speaker on the bottom right. The way I hold my phone, especially when playing games (three fingers behind, cradling on my pinky) blocks the speaker and I cannot hear the sound.\n\nBig picture, those are very small issues and this phone is an excellent step up from my previous phone (HTC One M8)",2016-03-29T20:02:0,BoomerGVL
Galaxy-s7,Love it so far!,"I used to have a Galaxy s5 from US Cellular. And while I loved the phone, I really hated the service. My mom has been with Verizon for years and hasn't had too many problems with them. So I decided to switch to Verizon after they released the Galaxy s7. It has the features of the s6 that I loved, only better designed. And it has expandable memory, which was the main reason I didn't upgrade to the s6 when it came out. I like to have a lot of music on my phones, and take a lot/save a lot of pictures. And sometimes the internal storage isn't enough for that. So bringing back this feature made me very happy. Not to mention, it's a gorgeous phone! Samsung's have always been some of my favorite phones. Never had any problems with them. This phone has a BEAUTIFUL display, good battery life, amazing features and cosmetics to the phone-loving my gold platinum!, and it has an AMAZING camera. Takes beautiful shots and video. The auto focus and blurring of the background has to be my favorite about the camera. I am not disappointed at all with this phone or my service. Thanks Verizon!",2016-03-29T19:55:2,CheyNicole

Galaxy-s7,excellent phone,Upgraded from Samsung S4 mini. Loved that phone and this is better. Easy to upgrade and all info backed up to phone seamlessly. Very fast processor and long battery life. Some items need to be relearned but would recommend this phone,2016-03-29T19:33:0,toothjockey
Galaxy-s7,The best phone available,"I've had the S7 for a couple weeks now and everything has worked great. I upgraded from the S4, which i had for over 2 years and was still working fine, but I wanted the S7 for the new faster camera and a longer lasting battery.\n\nPros:\n-Camera speed is super fast and crisp, and by double tapping the main button it opens immediately(great feature).\n-The fast-charging feature is amazing, my phone is usually fully charged before I can fall asleep at night.\n-battery life - I use my phone frequently and have yet to go below 50% after a full day of use.\n-Removeable SD storage is back, so you can increase your phones capacity.\n-Customization of your home screen with widgets/contacts/etc.\n\nCons:\nSize - I would have liked for the S7 to be the same size as the S7 edge. I wasn't sold on the edge feature and worried i'd end up with a cracked screen.",2016-03-29T19:29:0,Mrbiscuits
Galaxy-s7,Awesome phone easy to transfer pictures from any phone!!,I bought this phone a few weeks ago and love it!! Was easy to transfer things from even my old iPhone onto here plus the expanded memory!

Galaxy-s7,Very happy w/ my Galaxy S7! Regardless of...,"I am very happy with the expanded storage. A little disappointed that we have to use a different charger from the Samsung Galaxy S5. I love that it is waterproof! Especially since my 3 yrs old is very sneaky and fast. He has already taken it to the bath tub 3 times. I do everything with my phone, from personal use, to work, etc. So I am enjoying it very much. The design is a lot more sleek, but it's hard to use parts of the screen if you get one of those glass screen protectors. They don't cover the screen completely and if you put it in an otter box defender case it's even harder to use. The battery life could last longer, right now I get maybe 18 hrs out of it, and I am a light user. My old phone would last about 2 days. I thought about getting a new Apple phone, but I am glad I didn't since they don't offer expanded memory slots! Plus, the Galaxy phones are a lot easier to use!",2016-03-29T18:58:4,TjEng29
Galaxy-s7,It's a Galaxy!,Best galaxy so far! Have own the original galaxy s the s4 and now the s7. All great phones!

The technology blows iPhones away. I won't go back to Apple.",2016-03-29T18:46:3,Coastiekyle

Galaxy-s7,S5 to S7,"Coming from the S5 I see significant improvements, better display/camera quality, faster, lighter, better looking, and just overall an improvement. I skipped over the S6 because the two things I loved about the S5 were absent on the S6, but the S7 makes up for that by incorporating the expandable storage and water resistance, and considering it already starts as 32gb, my additional 32gb card is more than enough storage. ( I didn't have a sd card in my S5 until the begining of this year) Overall it's just a good phone, it does get warm to the touch when charging sometimes, but thus far I don't have any negatives to say about the phone, other than no tempered glass screen protectors yet( that account for the curve of the phone non edge model), but those should be rolling out early April, so nearly there. Set up was easy, customization easier as there's a theme option, unsure if that's on the S6 but it's a cool feature for sure, and unexpected, as I love to mod/customize my phones.",2016-03-29T18:12:5,Namii

A lot better camera with better picture quality and cool features. I LOVE that I can unlock the phone just with my thumb print in 1 second- no more entering a password!

I heard such great things about the S7, so I knew I would be getting a great product. I was like a kid at Christmas waiting for the arrival of my new phone. It was also a breeze to transfer all the data from my S4 to my S7 using the cloud service. I have only had the new phone for about 2 weeks now, and it is already so much better! There are so many improved features and I have only had it for a short time, so I am certain I will love it more the longer I have it. My Samsung Galaxy S4 was a great product and I was very happy with it. In fact, the only reason I did an upgrade was because it started to have serious issues. However, I am happy it did as I truly LOVE my new Galaxy S7!!! I cannot say enough about this product!",2016-03-29T18:00:2,Clover77

Galaxy-s7,Great Phone,"I love this phone, it's fast and great. Also, what you hear about the phone being water proof is true and it resists scratches. The only downfall is their is no remote control on this model, but if that doesn't bother you then it's a great phone.",2016-03-29T17:55:4,Brian027

I had to go on to the Internet and found out how to restart by holding the right button and the down volume at the same time.

Galaxy-s7,Great phone,"Upgraded from S5 so is very similar, but runs much faster. Not completely satisfied with the battery life, no better than the S5 but had higher expectations after reading reviews - too bad it can't be replaced like the S5 battery. There are a few quirks that haven't been resolved, but it may be the upgrade to the OS that's the problem rather than the phone (won't display text & email previews in notification bar). Has more memory plus has expandable via SD card so I now have space, but would have been nice if it was offered in 64. Camera is better than the S5 - clarity and takes pics faster.",2016-03-29T17:42:2,JoJoCrew
Galaxy-s7,Great Phone!,"I got this phone to upgrade my Galaxy S5 and specifically avoided upgrading to the S6. The water and dust-proof are fantastic durability features that should be default in most phones now. The addition of the expandable storage sold me on this phone. My one issue is the software, specifically all of the added apps that cannot be uninstalled. While this is only a small issue, it is something I wish all carriers and manufacturers would address. I would recommend this phone to anyone who wants a new phone, whether this is their first smartphone, android phone, or mobile device. Getting a tight fitting case is simply required to avoid dropping the slippery, glass phone.",2016-03-29T17:41:0,WesleyR

Galaxy-s7,Big advancement for our phones,"Brought the Galaxy S7 shortly after launch. These replaced our aging HTC DNAs.\nThis was as you might expect a huge leap. Speed and quality are amazing. In our location the signal strength is nearly zero. We had a network extender for our old phones. THe network extender is listed as not compatible with the S7s, but appears to work. Check with Verizon if you have an old network extender to make sure.\n\nOverall, the S7s have lived up to our expectations and will keep us on the Verizon network",2016-03-29T17:32:5,RichS7Galaxy
Galaxy-s7,Great phone. I consider it the best phone available.,Had a Galaxy 4. Would not purchase the 5 or 6 due to features. This phone has everything back that I was looking for. Only missing feature I would have liked to see is the 3.0 USB charging port. I would trade not replaceable battery for a water sealed phone any day. Especially one that has great battery life like the new S7 does. Great job with the minor adjustments of the screens and the camera features. I am still discovering some of the new features but I love this phone.,2016-03-29T17:30:3,Ivan 17

Galaxy-s7,Back to glory days,"This phone is everything that was great about the S5 AND it has an even better water rating than the S5, and rekindles our love with expandable storage. Just be careful when you pull out the SIMcard holder to place your microSD, that lil sucker of a SIM will shoot across the room, lol. It's also everything great about the S6, with none of it's faults(like the lack of water resistance, slippery in hand, etc). It's slicker, sexier, sits well in the hand, and has higher QUALITY camera and a higher grade of Gorilla Glass than the S6. Side note: Mega pixels are not and SHOULD NOT ever be used as a marker for quality of camera. If you don't get this, or how aperture and shutter speed effect your photos, you don't get photography and should sit down before you hurt yourself.\n\nOverall, I love this phone.",2016-03-29T17:28:5,whydoIneedauniquenickname

I had been turning off my data to give the WiFi connection a chance, I left it off after this update and tried out a few games I had previously been having issues with and they worked without any delays at all. I'm so very happy this issue has been taken care of, as this was the only real issue I was running into...now about this battery life...maybe with this update it will help the battery last just a bit longer as well.",2016-03-29T06:48:4,spesicka
Galaxy-s7,Great Phone!,"Coming from the HTC one this is a nice upgrade. It's fast, hasn't freezed yet and takes nice photos. The overall size and design of the phone is great, also has neat features. The only thing is the screen randomly lights up throughout the day, I've turned the always on feature off. I'm not sure if it's a glitch or what. Also I hate how the tempered glass cover fits the screen because of the slightly curved edges but I've learned to ignore it. I have horses so the water and dust resistance is a huge bonus. Definitely glad I pre-ordered!",2016-03-27T07:19:3,Kay6

Glad they brought it back, it's easy to put in/remove although you need a little tool to open the water resistant slot. The battery is true to the specs ~25 hours although it comes with many built in battery saving tools that can extend it longer.

Beautiful display, great camera, very easy to use. I've been streaming March Madness games regularly for hours and still have 30% battery at the end of the day. Call quality has been very good.

The screen is very clear and vibrant. The camera is top notch. Battery life is comparable to my old s4 with an extended battery in it. I only have three small complaints so far. 1. This version of Android does not have a music player like my old one did. I downloaded one from the play store and problem solved. 2. The ear buds it comes with do not block out any background noise which makes it hard to use them in noisy areas. 3. Probably the biggest issue.

Galaxy-s7,Best Samsung yet,"Coming from the Galaxy Note 2, which I liked quite a bit, this is a surprising step up. The s7 is faster, lighter, has better audio and video, better size and slightly better battery life. Fair warning, though, as a previous Android user, I found it pretty easy to navigate and customize. Someone coming from iOS or Windows Phone, or a smartphone newbie, might be a bit frustrated at first with getting everything set up the way they want. Also, nearly 10gb of the 32gb storage is taken up with system memory, but I have a 64gb microSD card, so no biggie for me. But overall, thumbs up !!",2016-03-21T00:20:4,milw nerd
Galaxy-s7,Long Battery & Fast Charging,"Loved that the step-by-step setup remembered my secured wifi from the previous phone. Picks up work wiifi with no lagging. Charging the phone for 20mins brings it up to 90%. Was worried about the picture taking. Much faster, clearer than previous phone! Cropping or magnifying a photo is so much better than previous phones. Love the fingerprint recognition to open the phone. Music streams beautifully.

Moving my contacts took less than 5mins, and they even bought back my 2 year old S5.\r\nBattery life is much better than the S5, which would have to be charged it before leaving work. The S7 is usually about 50% (off and on use throughout the day) by the time my day is done.

Galaxy-s7,"Great phone, would buy again, some gripes","1st, love the phone. Vast improvement over my Galaxy s4. The screen is amazing, colors so vibrant. Everything works great as expected. Apps load very quickly. Would definitely recommend. My gripes? Coming from the s4 and s3 and Blackberry, I am used to the plastic feel. The s7 being made with more metals and glass on the back, I am very over cautious and afraid of breaking it! I opted for an Otter Commuter case instead of a minimalist case because I am just so afraid of damaging it! Samsung: WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE IR BLASTER??? Was using the s4 as my home theater remote...no more. Disappointed. Ultra-fast scrolling in Apps like Facebook are still not as fast/fluid as iphone. It isn't bad, its actually pretty good, but I would love to see Samsung match the evil empire's fluidity because then there wouldn't be anything the Galaxy couldn't match on the iphone. Thankfully the expandable memory is there, had it on my s4, would have hated to not have it. Camera is awesome, love the new features, make sure you download the new \",2016-03-16T02:23:2,amallano
Galaxy-s7,Definitely better then the S6,"I had the S6 and enjoyed it. I thought that was nice but the S7 is so worth it. The feel of the phone is alittle lighter and feels oh so smoother. I love that the camera and home button are flat and not sticking out anymore. Same awesome sound quality as the s6. I thought the battery was long lasting on the s6, this phone definitely out dose it. It is faster and more responsive all together then the s6 and so far no occasional annoying pop ups like the s6 had. The extra storage and waterproof features are a plus. The camera photos are more crisp and bright. It controls the lighting better. I like the new mini control feature that can pop up when you're playing a game or app. It allows you to silence calls while you're playing and lock your home buttons if you want so you can't accidentally exit. There is so much more to explore I can't even think of upgrading in the future, this phone has everything I wanted!",2016-03-16T01:28:2,Eve8885
Galaxy-s7,All the good things about the S5 plus more,"I had the Samsung Galaxy S5 for a year and half and really enjoyed it as a phone. It was highly customizable, expandable memory, reliable, had a good battery life (and the option to throw in a new battery should I run through one), and overall performed very well.\r\n\r\nIt did have its issues, which in my opinion were iffy camera quality in low lighting and some lag with processing power. After a year and half I was noticing overall slower performance and heating issues.\r\n\r\nWhere the S6 abandoned all the good things about the S5, the S7 brought them back. I threw in a 200 GB memory card for all my music and photos, and the 32 GB capacity overall is much better for apps you want directly on your phone. The processor is FAST. Opening apps and browsing the web are a snap. The camera is beautiful - quick, crisp, clear. \r\n\r\nThe transition over from my S5 to the S7 was also incredibly painless. I was able to hook the 2 phones to each other with a piece included in the S7's packaging, and within an hour my new phone had all the apps, photos, messages, contacts, and videos my old phone had.\r\n\r\nThe dust and water rating on the S7 are a huge plus. I did like that my S5 was water resistant, but the bulky charger flap was kind of awkward. this phone has removed all awkward bulkiness, including the protruding camera bump (the back is now more smooth and even rounded to hold).\r\n\r\nI also got a wireless charging pad for my phone, and I think it's really cool. I don't use the fast charge for day to day stuff, but it's nice just to put your phone on the charging pad and wake up to a fully charged phone (sans wire.)\r\n\r\nI also got an external battery in case I needed it throughout the day, but even with consistent usage the batter lasts me 10 hours at least, usually going 12 or more.\r\n\r\nThe phone looks slick, virtually no camera bump on the back (yay!), and you still have the heart rate monitor and other cool built in features I loved about my S5. No floating toolbox, but that is downloadable.\r\n\r\nI recommend getting some kind of case, because the exterior shows all smudges and smears because it is such a slick, shiny phone. Also, it is an expensive and impressive piece of tech, def. worth protecting. I got a clear spigen to protect the phone but also show it off.\r\n\r\nI am so excited to have switched over, I reallllllly love my S7 :D",2016-03-15T20:29:1,vtbo
Galaxy-s7,"easy to use, great design",I upgraded from a S4. Worth the upgrade. I love the new curved design. It is easier to hold and grips better in my hand. With double the ram from the S4 I can do many things at once and it doesn't slow down. New UHD screen with a beautiful picture and the camera is much improved. I think it takes much crisper pictures than my wife's (not android) phone. You won't regret buying this phone!,2016-03-15T19:39:5,Baxman
Galaxy-s7,Smooth and Fast upgrade from S4,I love the quickness of the camera and launching apps. The battery life is great but that is expected for a new phone I guess. Much louder speaker and clearer than my S4. I am glad I waited for this one. I saw the S6 but wasn't ready to ditch my S4. My old phone messed up copying data over to new phone but hooked up cable as S7 did the rest. Smooth interface and load times are great. I haven't tried getting it wet but it looks and feels like it can handle it. Just not going to go swimming with it lol.,2016-03-15T19:13:3,Joshfinne
Galaxy-s7,So far so good.,Lots of compliments on gold colorway. Phone is very good. Speedy and intuitive. Camera good not great. Overall the best phone I have ever owned.,2016-03-15T19:02:0,Jonatin
Galaxy-s7,Best Galaxy yet,"As all the reviews out there will tell you, there are few if any flaws with the new S7. I just traded in my Edge +, which I loved, but got tired of the larger size not fitting into any regular sized pocket. Additionally, I love that Samsung added back the SD card capability along with the water resistance and dust proof. Performance is outstanding.",2016-03-15T13:44:2,SeverusS7
Galaxy-s7,LOVE this phone,"I consider this easy to use, but I used to have a Galaxy III so am also pretty familiar with Galaxy features. I actually paid off an LG4 I only had for a few months to get the Galaxy 7. Now, with the 7, I can talk on the phone without dropping calls when people text or message me or dial in. It is smaller, which I prefer than the LG4 or the Edge - it can fit in a pocket much easier. I have horses, so the water and dust resistance is terrific. The only thing I wish could be different is where the power button is located. It is too easy to hit and get the black screen. Well worth that minor irritant though. LOVE it, LOVE it. Also it would be nice if the battery lasted longer. That was the ONLY thing the LG4 had as an advantage. Galaxy is the way to go.",2016-03-15T02:56:2,LuPicasso

Galaxy-s7,"Great camera, Wireless charging finally works","I had the s6 edge for a short while. With a Samsung charging pad it would charge up and then stop with an error on the charger and discharge overnight. Same pad works flawlessly with the S7. I have had the phone for a week now, no problems encountered.\r\n\r\nCamera takes great low light pictures, looks great on the screen and on other computers. No perceptible delays snapping shots.\r\n\r\nI just added a 64g memory card, no surprises and it automatically reconfigured to store pictures on it.",2016-03-15T00:10:0,JohnnyH

Galaxy-s7,A worthy Upgrade,"I finally upgraded from my 3 year old Galaxy S3 and WOW what a difference! I was disappointed with the S6 and I am glad I held out for the S7! This thing is FAST, Easy to use and the camera takes incredible pix! It was great to be able to transfer all my aps with the smart transfer feature or whatever its called. Even worked without issue with my old S3. Battery life seems to be excellent also. As I type this my phone has been off the charger for 11 hours now, and I've been using it most of the day, and I still have 70% of the battery left.\r\n\r\nIf you've been holding out like I was, you don't have to any longer.",2016-03-14T20:25:5,TinIndian42

Galaxy-s7,"So far, one great device!","I just received my S7 on Friday, March 11th; to replace my S4. Out of the box I was impressed with the structure and the familiarity of the new S7. The transfer of my files, pictures, contacts, video's, accounts, settings, and apps was smooth and flawless. I simply backed everything up (which took the longest amount of time), and then turned on the wireless transfer app (Android Beam) and touched them together and bam! All my stuff was transferred to my new S7 in a matter of minutes - flawlessly. I was impressed with how fast the phone charges - minutes, I mean literally minutes, folks. The fingerprint log in is outstanding and easy to set-up and use. Pictures are beautiful, even though the rear is only 12mp's; and the front camera is just as good, even at only 5mp's. The low light setting for the camera is just - wow! On my S4 a dark room would have been completely blacked out; however, on the S7 it is visible, albeit with a yellow hint, which is to be expected from such low lighting. I don't plan on taking too many pictures in a dark room, so think I can deal with that. Love how the apps for Verizon, Google, and Amazon are grouped into one icon - fabulous - takes up less space in the apps pages. On my S4, I had 4 or 5 pages of apps; now I have 3 pages total. I took it to work with me on Saturday and the battery lasted all day long - it has yet to go below 65% without needing a charge. I topped it off this morning before going to work, and right now it is still at 87% - this is fantastic. My old S4 would have to be charged everyday - not the S7. Of course the real test will come on Thursday when I am off, and can really sit and play with it. Then we'll see how long the battery lasts before needing a charge. So, so far, I can't say enough about this phone. I have used the alarm to wake me up for work, and it is great at waking me on time. Texting is simple and pretty much the same as with the S4 I had, with the exception of the new emoticons added - I really like them. The screen is beautiful. And the fact that I have small hands, with it being narrower, I can actually use the phone one handed, where I couldn't with my S4. My S4 has now been passed on to my husband, and he is really loving it. I may have just created another Galaxy fan! Thanks Samsung and Verizon for another wonderful Galaxy product. I will update this review later when I have a little more time with my new S7 - but so far - I absolutely love it! If you are scared to buy a new phone before all the glitches have been worked out - don't be with the S7 - it is great, straight out of the box!",2016-03-14T04:27:0,mrshendricks072412
Galaxy-s7,Great Phone!,"Finally replaced my Galaxy S3 with the S7. The difference is day and night. The S7 is very fast and the display is like the difference between SD and HD TV. Battery life also a great improvement. Phone has been on 12 hours today and I have been messing with a lot, and it still has 50% battery left. Will recharge from 30% in about 1.5 hours. Don't think any of these phones are worth the price we are being charged, but what can we do, if we want a great smart phone....they've got us. Regardless......this IS a great phone, I am happy with my purchase, would buy it again and would definitely recommend it.",2016-03-14T02:02:5,Andym0097

Galaxy-s7,Fantastic,"I received the new phone a couple of days ago and could not be more happy. I finally decided it was time to move into the modern world and upgraded from a basic flip phone. \r\nThe Galaxy S7 is stylish, fast, and can do everything my iPad Air can do. \r\nThe set up was simple. I had sent my contacts through Backup Assistant to the cloud and by the time I finished going through the set up steps, my contacts and pic were on my new phone. \r\nI connected to my Wi-Fi at home and updated the operating system, installed a few apps and I was all set. \r\nUse of the phone is extremely intuitive. I like it better than the smartphone my wife has from a different manufacturer that shall remain nameless. \r\nMy voice sounds like it is in a chamber when I listen on my wife's phone, but her voice is crystal clear on mine. She has had issues with voice quality from other phones before. \r\nI highly recommend the S7.",2016-03-13T16:26:1,DandelionMan
Galaxy-s7,The Smart Phone I have always been waiting for.,"Years ago I tried android and didn't like it. I have been on Iphone for a long time. But I have grown so tired of Iphone that last summer I switched to windows phone. Still not what I was looking for. I started looking for a good android phone so I could give them another try. In my search I saw that Samsung was releasing a new Galaxy soon. So as I read rumors and expected features I grew anxious. Then when the announcement came and all the rumors were correct I said this is the phone for me. I pre ordered my Galaxy S7 and received it before the official sale date. I am super excited. Ok enough on how I got to android. Now about the phone. \r\nThis is the best phone I have ever held in my hands. Super fast, Expandable storage, Large Battery, Wireless Charging, Water Proof, Amazing Camera, And able to be customized to what ever your liking is. Samsung listens to what the customers want. Something Apple does not do. \r\nI have been on Android for 5 days now and I am loving it compared to IOS and windows phone. If Samsung keeps putting out products like this they have a life long customer. But because I love this phone so much I doubt I will be trading it in when the next galaxy comes out. I'll hang on to this one for at least 2 years. Besides its going to be very very hard to top the very best phone ever made. \r\nBy the way, Wireless Charging is very fast. I also bought the Samsung Fast Wireless Charger. Well worth it. I also purchased a Case-Mate barely there Clear case and a tempered glass screen protector. \r\nIf any of you are IOS users or Windows phone users that are thinking of switching over to Android give the Samsung Galaxy S7 a try. I am sure you will be just as pleased with it as I am. \r\nI highly recommend this phone. BUY IT!!",2016-03-13T01:36:5,scotiezND

Galaxy-s7,Perfect sized beast,I must say this is a perfectly sized phone with absolutely all the features the S6 lacked and even more. I will be using this phone on my daily workouts so the waterproof feature will be very useful. I can also fit this phone perfectly in my purse or jeans pocket with ease. I love that they brought the expandable storage back as I love music and I also love to read ebooks and I was really weary about the onboard 32 gb storage.The color is gorgeous.The black onyx is a deep rich black.

This phone is amazing! the graphics are next level, it's so easy to use, and just flat out amazing. I just got it yesterday, and thus far I am very very pleased. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the front facing camera. The camera use a default beauty filter, which enhances your photo and I'm not crazy about that.

I am SO glad that I pre-ordered and that it showed up today!!!\r\n\r\nThe ONLY thing that I'm not liking for accessories is that the glass protectors that I've come across will only fit the flat part of the screen, so it's about 1/8\",2016-03-10T01:22:5,SuzieQ2016

The camera takes photos that look professional. My S7 did also, but I was never able to capture the moon in any picture I took. This one is filled with new full moon shots from last night. The overall colors are bright and very appealing. I miss a couple things, like extra volume, battery replacement option and the fact I just can't seem to find how to do things.

My fingers are just too big for the new tiny buttons and texts never come out correctly, whether I use the swipe or traditional method.

Galaxy-s7,Samsung Apps are not preloaded,"I am a pretty loyal customer and I like to stay with what works. I really loved my S5 and I assumed the S7 would be remarkable. However, the powers that be a t Verizon decided not to preload the Samsung app/store. Very disappointing! One of the things I most appreciated about the S5 was the car mode. As soon as I connected my bluetooth (powered it up) the phone became a very usable device through my voice. It was seamless. In facr, I could not use my phone any other way that through voice commands. SO SAFE!!!! Now, I have had to dl the app and it does not work the same. In fact, everytime I engage the app I have to manually agree to the terms. Which means I have to take my eyes off of the road! BAD FORM! The app also seems a bit glitchy, where before it was REMAARKABLE!\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is more a Samsung issue that Verizon, and make no mistake, I will share my opinion there too. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for listening!",2017-01-05T18:55:2,Kbrider

The S7 has totally different sound quality which is hard to get used to.  It sounds like you are talking into a tin can ... or in a small room.  They tell me it's the same for the person you are talking with as well (must be the mic and speaker).  Camera seems to be good.  Getting use to all the new features now ... seems fine.

I drive a truck for a living,the same route everyday, I know where the dead spots are, I don't know if it's the phone or the service,but they are all gone. No dropped calls with verizion. I like the larger screen of the note 4. That is the only drawback, which is minor on the S7. If I had the eyes of a younger man, I would give the S7 5 stars.",2016-12-04T13:55:1,TruckerPete

Galaxy-s7,S7 actually downgrade from S5 in many ways - Except for speed and resolution,"Upgraded (allegedly) two S5's to S7's for my wife and I. The S7's are very fast, things open quickly. The S7 Screen is twice the resolution of S5, but seems to make many thin fonts almost unreadable, so had to change fonts in settings. Camera in S7 is way more responsive than S5, but lower resolution. Touchscreens on S7's seem to have a life of their own, miss a lot of touches, and sometimes do things before being actually touched. On screen keyboards are way more error prone than S5's, even in side by side use. I was also disappointed in the fact that the S7 does not have the Infrared port that the S5 did. I used that feature with TV/Audio remote apps and DSLR Camera remote apps, and already miss it. Kind of like when Samsung took the FM radio feature out after the S2. Last, but not least, S7's have a very small curve at the very edge of the screen that hinders use of any hard screen protectors. Overall, other than speed of processor the S5 still looks to be better in many ways, and I would give the S5 a 5-star where I give the S7 only 4.\r\n\r\nOn the touchscreen error issue, Verizon has locked out the keyboard commands that used to work on Galaxy's to get to things like touchscreen adjustments.

There are some updated features; however, one of my most used features, the smart alarm on the clock, is no longer on this phone.  This is very disappointing as I used it every day; there's nothing worse that waking up to a blaring alarm.  I did notice that there's a feature to make the first 60 seconds louder, again why would you want this.  It would be great if Samsung would bring back this feature, maybe with an update.

Galaxy-s7,Great phone except for reception when using as a phone.,Everything with the phone is great except the reception.  Drops calls and when talking you can only hear portions of the conversation.  Sometimes the other person on the line can only hear portions of what you say.  My wife and I both purchased the S7 and are experiencing the same thing.  This occurs in my house.  Our S4 in the house never had a problem.  We do not have a home phone so our cell phones are our only means for placing and receiving calls.  Plus I work from home and the only way my employer can talk to me is by my cell phone.  We haven't traveled since purchasing the S7 so I can not say for sure if this occurs any where else.  I did activate the phone so that we can receive and place calls through WIFI.  That seems to have help.,2016-11-28T16:58:5,mphillipsaz

I think the battery is better and like the fact that I can expand the memory and particularly that it is again waterproof, like the S5. I read that the S7 had a better camera, but that I don't understand.  It is a significant reduction in pixels, but also is a 4x3 standard aspect ratio - vs. the wide screen version on the S6 and S5.   I would rather have my old camera back.",2016-10-26T19:06:5,jdcenfl

Specifically there are some apps that I used a lot in my work that are not available with Android phones or the equivalent is not as good. Additionally it's a little bit more cumbersome with the different apps. Apple has everything working seamlessly but none apple phones are a bit piecemeal. So you kind of have to pick between going all Samsung apps versus all Google apps versus Verizon apps.  if you ve had iPhones it can be a bit frustrating because none of them communicate with each other well. it seems to take me more steps to do things then my iPhone did.

One thing that annoys me about the phone is that the screen is too sensitive along the edges; it opens apps, etc. just from me picking up my phone. Other than that, I don't mind the switch.",2016-10-12T14:02:4,KP406
Galaxy-s7,Still learning!,Print on phone is easier to read than previous model. Also like that phone is thinner and not as heavy.,2016-10-11T22:45:5,Marjie B
Galaxy-s7,Significant Improvement Over Galaxy S4 Mini,"I've only had the phone for two weeks now, so I'm still adjusting to it.  Even though it's larger than the Galaxy S4 Mini that it has replaced, it still fits comfortably in my hand.  However, I do wish that the phones could be smaller to fit more easily into my pockets.  The screen is much sharper than the S4 Mini, and it holds a charge much longer.  I added the flexible glass screen protector, and so far it is very easy to navigate.",2016-10-11T21:08:1,Pittsburgh Slim
Galaxy-s7,Almost 5 stars...,"I've had my phone for a little over a week & I really like it. I like all the features & how much you can customize everything. The only thing I have an issue with is the battery. It doesn't last as long as I'm used to with my old HTC phone. It's great having a super fast charger but I feel like I'm charging it a lot for a new phone. Back to the things I like... I really like the size of the phone. It's not too big & it fits nicely in my hand. It's very fast. I find that I don't have to wait for anything I click on which is especially nice when it comes to the camera & the gallery. I love how fast both apps open. I also like how fast you can transition to the gallery from the camera after taking a picture. Another thing I find super helpful is having the ability to share directly from the screen after taking a screenshot. I use this feature a lot. I like being able to delete screenshots from the notification bar as well. I was very happy to see such a wide variety of options and features available for me to look at, edit, change & customize in the settings application. I went through each topic,  made sure I fully understood it & made the phone my own. I really like the thumb print access, too. Overall the phone has exceeded my expectations. The only thing I have a problem with is battery life which is unfortunate because that's kind of a big deal. Besides that the phone is exactly what I needed & wanted. I was an HTC customer, only owning HTC phones since I first owned a smartphone, but I took a gamble & got my Samsung Galaxy S7. Fortunately this is a decision I do not regret. Im glad I have made the switch because this is really a great phone & I'm much happier with it than I thought I would be. I didn't expect to love it so much!",2016-10-11T19:06:5,Maldrich487

Having the power button almost directly across from the volume buttons poor design as well, I accidentally turn my phone off when trying to turn the volume down.",2016-10-06T19:49:1,Doldra

Galaxy-s7,Updated Features without Too Much Change,"I had the S5 for about 2 and a half years previous to my S7. After certain features were starting to not work, I knew I needed a new phone and knew I wanted to stick with Samsung. The Note and Edge both are amazing phones, from brief usage in the store and seeing the new features in ads. After testing them out in the store, I came to the conclusion I wanted to stick to the regular S7. It's a perfect size for me and about the same size as my S5. I personally am not a huge fan of big phones as I dislike have large or bulky things in my pockets. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the S7 after now using it for 2 weeks, is great. I really like the updates to the operating system and hardware but most importantly how much it is like the S5. Menus, system applications, and customization are almost exactly like the S5. It's not that I don't like change when getting new electronics but it made operating my new phone much easier. I didn't have that week of learning new menus, keystrokes, or paths. It was simple and straightforward.",2016-10-06T13:57:1,balkyreek

Galaxy-s7,"Great phone, needs better software","The phone is fast, has a much better feel than previous Galaxy phones.  Buttons a crisp feel.  My only complaint, and I don't know if it's due to the lack of programming from Samsung or Google is the fact that you cannot set which WiFi spots to automatically connect to.  It's pretty much all or none.  I would like to just connect to specific spots like work and home automatically and not every WiFi my phone encounters, because when it's a weak signal it turns your phone into a useless brick while using tons of battery power trying to connect  until you turn the WiFi off.  I would have held out for the new Pixel phones if Google hadn't choked with those having only an IP53 rating!",2016-10-01T20:08:1,scot1

Galaxy-s7,Very similar to the Samsung galaxy s5,I had to return my first phone the day after receiving it because callers had a hard time hearing me.  They would say that my voice was breaking up when I was seated in the same place.  My signal has always been strong so that is not an issue.  I also do not like how I cannot change the background color of my contacts list.  It is an ugly orange color.  I  contact Samsung and they couldn't do it either.,2016-09-14T19:40:5,rockycez

Galaxy-s7,"Finally, A Phone You Can Talk On","I've stayed away from Android phones because their voice quality is shallow and muddy.  The S7 is a real exception.  Call clarity is topnotch; it's almost Blackberry quality, and a huge improvement over my last Android phone: Galaxy S3. As for the rest of the phone's functionality, there's nothing special.  The screen is bright and viewable in the sun, but other than that, it  runs like any other Android.  It  is terribly slippery and fragile, so a bumper case is a requirement before putting it to use.  But the terrific call quality is worth the premium price.",2016-09-11T14:57:1,GSNCA

The phone is great, reception great, performance is amazing, display is unreal, battery life is great for stock (You can't upgrade or access the battery so I count that against this model). Also when running VR apps or high resolution games the S7 gets hot and not a little hot it freaking bakes and starts to throttle the cores to reduce the heat which results in laggy and nausea. I kill everything except my VR apps and it still is scorching.

Galaxy-s7,Great performing smartphone,"I wasn't in the market for a new phone, but when the charging port on my Note 4 got wrecked, I decided if I could upgrade, I'd get the latest and greatest Samsung phone. After about a week of having this, I know that was the right decision. It's a great Android device, syncing perfectly with everything I had right from the get-go. It's a smaller screen than I was used to, but nothing to complain about. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the battery can get REALLY hot with extended use. Certain media-heavy apps heat up the battery so much it's almost too warm to continue hanging on to. After a few minutes of downtime, though, it cools off. It also has an extremely long battery life (except when using Pokemon Go). It would be nice if the battery was more accessible in case I had to do any sort of manual shut off for issues that may arise, but it's something I can get over since I don't foresee issues anytime soon.",2016-07-19T18:23:3,Dagon

The single rough point is the transfer of some Smemo files from the s4. They showed up in the new phone but I have not yet been successful in opening them. I like the water resistance since I did once drown a phone. Overall I am very happy with this purchase and this may become a five star review after I get more used to the phone.

The battery power isn't what he professed it to be, & there are a lot of apps I wish I could get rid of (a reason I was leaning toward the HTC) that have been sending a lot of ads. The photo quality is great, & the phone is splash proof (I haven't fully submerged it). Those were 2 characteristics I was definitely wanting in my new phone. I loved my former phone, the HTC M8 & was sold on the HTC 10 before I even got there, but after having the S7, I have to say they are very comparable.

Galaxy-s7,Many useful features. Impressed with range of capability.,I bought this phone as an upgrade for a flip open phone (pre-paid acct). Picture quality and resolution much better than our older phone.  I also like the wi-fi access and find that very useful.  This phone is worlds apart from non-smart phones.  The countless available apps are amazing - and it has video capability.  Texting is much better.,2016-07-08T22:47:3,TrainsGuy

Galaxy-s7,good but frustrating,"I have had the phone for two weeks now. I can not use the power saving mode as it will not allow the voice mail app to work, it affects Bluetooth connections and creates issues with Facebook and Facebook messenger apps. My only other compliant is that it will not allow me to set ringtones or notification other than the default on many of hte apps or contacts.\r\nOther than that the phone is pretty good, sound quality is better than my S5 and the 32 gig is great, the phone is not running out of space like the S5 did almost immediately.",2016-07-08T18:22:4,TriJedi

Galaxy-s7,Best Galaxy Out There,"I got this device 2 days before it was released because I preordered it, I also got a free gear s2 from preordering. The phone I will say only really needs a better battery, 6-8GBs of ram, and Micro USB-C to stay ahead of the competitors. I recommend this phone on the daily and I think it is a beautiful phone, Samsung gets better and better every year. I do really love the fact that you can upgrade every year with this phone as well, not saying that I will get tired of the phone or that I am not satisfied with it but I do know that all manufacturers are making all phones more expensive to buy and it is just nice to know you have all the options.",2016-07-07T23:51:2,CR112

There was also a small issue when I first started the droid with messages not coming in but once that was taken care of we are pretty good!!,2016-07-07T13:37:5,gogussy
Galaxy-s7,Good device - one main problem,"This could be a great device. Almost identical to GS6 with more memory, speed, better battery. And also the return of SD Ram slot and water resistance.  I have one big problem, the screen.  The screen display should be it best feature but for some reason Samsung chose to give it a slight barely noticeable curve on the edges (I am not talking about the S7 Edge version of the phone).  This slight curve makes it impossible to get almost any tempered glass screen display to fit properly on this unit.  You have to choose between tempered glass which does not cover the width of the screen or you can go with some models that try to fit the full width but won't stick on the curved edges and will allow dust underneath.  This may seem like a minor complaint but this phone is too expensive to go without a screen protector and all the ones available for the phone don't fit.  GS6 does not have this issue because the screen is perfectly flat a tempered glass fits perfectly.  It is annoying to the point where I may consider returning it because I have a screen protector that doesn't cover the entire screen and it looks terrible.  Search for every screen protector for this phone and read the reviews for the screen protector.  They are mostly bad reviews because they don't cpover the screen or they do cover it but won't stick on the edges.  Turns out that it is not the fault of the screen protector, it is the fault of the screen designed by Samsung.",2016-07-07T04:08:2,mitch053

Galaxy-s7,Good phone; time-consuming transition,"The GS7 has great features, and does pretty much everything as well as or better than my prior phone, the GS5 (the only tech glitch on the GS7 is a strange echo in the sound portion on a few apps; I need to figure out which of the other apps is causing this, as that seems to be the likely culprit, based on some initial research).  Porting over all my data and apps took quite a while (nearly 3 hours!), and not everything came over.  Samsung needs to get their act together in this respect -- the direct data transfer software is slow and glitchy.  Also -- Samsung -- I'm very, very unhappy that the battery is not removeable.  There's no legit reason for that.  I almost didn't buy this phone for that reason alone, and next time, it'll be a deal-breaker.",2016-07-04T19:18:2,LODJA

Galaxy-s7,"Great phone, updated, super fast with an annoying flaw.","Great phone, upgrade from my S5 that I loved. Everything runs amazingly fast! It has a crisp user interface, TouchWiz is less annoying in fact better than native Google options at this point. Samsung even has me enjoying there Web browser over chrome or Firefox. I have 2 issues however with the build of the phone physically. The speaker is in an annoying spot and easily muffled by how I naturally hold my phone in landscape as well as portrait. 1 other issue is the screen glass has a slight bevel to it. In itself that is fine but when trying to find a screen protector solution it is HORRIBLE! I've tried a few options and have yet to find a protector that can cover the entire exposed glass edge to edge and not lose sensitivity. Hopefully i will find a good fit soon. With my s5 having a flat screen it was simple and worked PERFECT. Aside from those things the phone is amazing and would still purchase it against the devices available today.

Galaxy-s7,I hope you appreciate the amount of time it took me to write this review,"This review is getting 4 stars because I was going to give it 3, but my sister, who has my phone's fraternal twin gave it 5. So we're splitting the difference. Please note that the phones we had before were LG Spectrum II's so upgrading to a Galaxy S7 felt like walking out of the smartphone stone age.\r\n\r\nPros according to my sister:\r\nFast\r\nTakes amazing photos\r\nScreen is a good size\r\nAndroid\r\nDouble clicking the home button launches camera\r\nScreen capture with a gesture! Sweet.\r\nRuns apps and games really well. (Very important for Neko Atsume. Because cats are serious business.)\r\n\r\nCons according to my sister:\r\nBefore getting a case, the rounded screen kept registering touch along edges when the device was picked up or being held. Bought a case and no longer have this issue.\r\nGets warm to hot during use\r\nA little too slim\r\nLack of removable battery\r\nCost is high\r\n\r\nPros according to me:\r\n1) Fast (faster than my desktop computer that's how fast what is this witchcraft science?)\r\n2) Nice features\r\n3) Good size screen. Not tiny, not obnoxious\r\n4) Gold color I got mine in is pretty snazzy\r\n5) You can buy cases for them on Society6 and support an artist doing so.\r\n6) Easter egg in marshmallow is delightful.\r\n7) It scans apps you download for threats.\r\n8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me laugh.\r\n\r\nCons according to me:\r\n1) It gets fudging hot with not much use, which makes me nervous because my last phone overheating over and over during use is what eventually killed it.\r\n2) Battery is not removable. First phone I've owned like this. Not cool. What if it fails? What if it stops holding a charge? What if my phone does the same thing my past phones have done and constantly reboot until the battery is removed and replaced? Now I can't carry extra batteries in case of emergencies. Power packs are expensive and not practical for me.\r\n3) Stupidly expensive phone. Only got them because I've paid the cell bill for the last three years, so now I am trading this responsibility with my sister for two years.\r\n4) No physical keyboard (a rare thing for smartphones to have one nowadays. If you don't suffer from Zombie Finger this probably isn't an issue for you, but it is for me.)\r\n5) Phone is slim and slippery. I suggest a strong, grippy case if you drop things often.\r\n6) Due to assinine price this is the first phone I've owned that made me feel insurance was necessary. \r\n7) I typed this review on this phone and thanks to my Zombie Finger my blood pressure spiked at least a dozen times. Nice murder attempt, phone. I'm still alive. Try harder next time. (Please don't)\r\n8) Sometimes autocorrect makes me want to murder.\r\n9) It knows too much.\r\n\r\nBeen using the phone too long. Time to let it cool down.",2016-06-04T05:17:4,Wind Sama
Galaxy-s7,Samsung Galaxy S7,I find the phone works well as a telephone. I do have issues with the battery.

Galaxy-s7,Takes getting used to!,"After years of having an iPhone, I decided to go to Samsung. I had had a Droid X and liked that so I thought an Android phone would be a nice change. My Galaxy 7s has been a challenge. Very sensitive to movement and easily changes apps with hardly any movement. The apps move around on the home screen for no apparent reason. Goggle and Verizon have put so many apps on this phone that it is ridiculous!. I have attempted to delight them and they just keep coming back. Help! I do love the camera and the sound is OK.

Galaxy-s7,My first smart phone...,Nice phone but the learning curve is more than I expected.  Had to upgrade in order to use my phone in Canada.  Samsung does not include the manual with the phone.    The user manual is about 160+ pages and you have to print the manual.  How much would that have cost them to produce?  The audio is clear and the volume is fine for senior citizens.  Had a problem with notifications when receiving text messages.  Called Verizon and had to talk to first and second level support to get the sound working on text notifications.  Not sure why Samsung has TWO places in the menu that must be turned ON for the sound notifications to work on the phone.  I am sure in time I will master the device.  The primary reason I chose this phone over an Apple phone was the water-proof feature and the glass on the screen being resistant to breaking.  The phone must be able to withstand a working environment which my old Casio G'Zone did very well.,2016-05-31T01:20:2,buzzcook

Galaxy-s7,It's not really missing a star!,This is my first Samsung Android except for a modded Gear.  I usually stayed away from S because of Knox.  But now I consider the world we live in and I'm thankful that I'm not the only one for whom it is extremely difficult to compromise this device.  None of that interferes with performance.  Everything on this phone happens in a snap.  Be sure to check out all the settings and the settings inside settings to not miss out.  Save your thumbprint so you can unlock and get home with one touch.  I have the beautifully designed gold one and it gets noticed (not what I was after but not complaining).   And if you thought it was impossible for S to get out a better looking screen (as if human mind could suddenly stop innovating) think again.  Quad HD in a phone display...   I never rate anything as the best even if it is in my experience.  This is because in everything is room for improvement.,2016-05-29T22:21:1,Boss2016

Just seems to run down faster than the older model.",2016-05-27T17:39:5,tcosey76
Galaxy-s7,So far so good.,I have only had this phone about a week and a half and so far I have no complaints. I even got the LifeProof case to go with iteven though it is water resistant. I go through a lot of cold wet canyons so needed a phone that can handle the abuse while canyoneering. If it holds up to the abuse I will be a Samsung fan for life.,2016-05-27T00:58:3,Gary T
Galaxy-s7,Awesome features love the water resistant feature.,I just got my phone on the 18th and for the most part so far so good. Only issue I seem to be having is both my Galaxy S7 and my son's new Galaxy S7 phones seem to get hot at times. I will be sure to call in and make sure this can't become an issue but at this time it's the only minor concern we both have with the phones. The features are wonderful and the camera is superb I don't think I will ever want to go without this level of camera abilities again because taking pictures is my life. The overall phone graphics are great nice and crisp and very clear. Overall pricing good be a lot better this is a completive market and with the awesome service there's room to bring on many more customers by making the service more cost effective for the clients which interns ands more features and lines a customer could afford to have.,2016-05-26T21:12:0,Lazybonez303
Galaxy-s7,Gary,My reception strength is not as good as my s4,2016-05-26T18:44:5,CauseImLucky
Galaxy-s7,Great features.,Great features on the applications to make each one to suit your needs. Camera is excellent. Voice calls are crystal clear. But it will drop calls more than it should. Although i do have data in places my iphone didnt! Battery drains fast so have a charger on hand. The screen in plenty big enough. Over all I am very happy with this phone and would recommend it to anyone.,2016-05-26T18:40:1,GeriH
Galaxy-s7,Easy Transition,"I made the change from an LG G2 to the S7. It was an easy transition. The phone can probably do about 1,000 things and I do about 10 things. The camera is amazing! Both front and rear-facing is clear.",2016-05-26T12:52:1,AngelFish
Galaxy-s7,Easy to use.,Bought it 8 days ago.  Still getting used to the minor differences from my old phone.  Phone is really easy to use and navigate.  Good battery life so far.  Takes great photos as well.,2016-05-26T02:00:0,Vixx
Galaxy-s7,A very solid selection,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 to the S7.  After having the phone for about two weeks, I continue to be satisfied.  I am very pleased with the quality of images captured using the device's camera, and the ease of storing them on the SD card.  I guess I must be a heavy user, because I require a little charging boost during the day (an overnight charge is not sufficient to last through the day).  I often use my phone one-handed, and the one-handed feature has proven to be very helpful.  The option to launch the camera with a double tap on the home key is also great.  It is these little conveniences that make me really like this phone.",2016-05-25T20:37:0,Ange0
Galaxy-s7,Easy to use,Got this phone recently. I upgraded from the galaxy 5. Pretty much the same phone with some upgrades.,2016-05-25T20:31:4,Greene21
Galaxy-s7,Great features. Great design.,"I bought this a week ago, after my Glorious Droid Turbos' screen cracked.  I must say it's a great phone. The battery is a bit smaller in capacity but I get similar usage time so that is a plus. Fingerprint lock is simple and quick to set up; its feauture rich overall. Truly smart phone.  The only thing im not too fond of is the camera, hopefully it grows on me.",2016-05-25T19:40:2,Tamia84

Galaxy-s7,"Easy to use, better app usage and storage","I have had my phone for 2 weeks. My S4 was dying faster on me after 2 and a half years. I wanted an upgrade and got the S7. I used the cloud to transfer information over from my old phone to my new one, but the S7 does come with a device that makes it super easy to transfer information from one phone to another. I would rate the S7 a five star, however I don't seem to have a privacy folder anymore, and there are some things I don't want others to see but me!\r\n\r\nOverall,  it's a great phone and I am enjoying it!!",2016-05-25T02:46:1,Deener
Galaxy-s7,Happy I Upgraded,I was uncertain about upgrading to the S7 because I wasn't having any problems to speak of with my S4 but now I'm happy that I did. I have double the storage and a number of the apps that were giving me trouble on the S4 are running perfectly on the S7.,2016-05-25T01:30:4,mys7

Galaxy-s7,Love it!,Love the S7. The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it doesn't have the edit features on the camera that my S5 had. Maybe when it updates. It does everything faster and better than the 5. The camera is a lot better just can't frame or add stickers to your pictures,2016-05-21T20:53:1,Dhav128

Galaxy-s7,Nice Upgrade,"Had the phone for about 3 weeks. Overall, very happy with it. Unlike other reviewers, I was upgrading from an S4, so this S7 was a huge step up. The S4 would overheat constantly and was becoming slow as all get out and would not make it through the day on a charge. The S7 so far has made it to the end of the day with several phone calls and texts plus maybe 30 mins - 1 hr total of browsing or streaming video. Better than the last phone but not as good as you think it would be based on the extra weight. Very nice, fast and sharp camera. Great screen and I like the figerprint unlock. A couple flaws: the power button is too low to and interferes with my dashboard phone holder; The screen although it appears to be flat is actually curved back slightly on the two long edges, meaning that the glass ZAGG screen protector the Verizon rep convinced me to buy actually does not touch along the edges making it difficult when you are trying to slide apps around on the home screens - plus it is starting to catch some dirt. Regarding storage: the native memory is sufficient for most users, but I decided to mount an SD card for pics and video. The card appears to not stay connected in there very well, as a few times a week a get a notification that an SD card has been attached, as if it is disconnecting and reconnecting periodically.",2016-05-09T14:10:1,Morena706

Galaxy-s7,This is what the S6 should have been,"As headline says, this is the phone we should have had as the S6. However, coming from an aging S4 (which is still a great phone), I am happy with this model. Minor quirks but overall a nice phone.\nPros:\n1) Very nice camera that doesn't lag as previous one did. Fast shutter speed and low light aperture compensates very nice in dim lit rooms.\n2) 32gb onboard this time is great. As many phones come with a standard 16gb, eaten up by the OS and updates doesn't leave much for user space. pair that with a nice size SD card and you shouldn't have to fret over space anymore.\n3) Battery is a bump up from the S5 (let's just forget the S6 battery even happened). It could have been a little bigger. I am all for battery life over how \",2016-05-08T16:00:1,Baxter97123

Galaxy-s7,"Good, but I'm underwhelmed","Overall, I like the phone, but I must say I'm underwhelmed. I moved to the S7 from the Nexus 6p for various reasons and let me tell you, the 6p blows the doors off the S7. I remember being impressed more by the S3 when it came out, which was, next to the 6p, the best phone I ever owned. Maybe it was because the S3 was rather novel at the time. I just haven't seen much advancement and innovation from the S line since the S3. The S7 camera takes great pictures, though.",2016-05-06T16:10:5,Docof doom

Galaxy-s7,"Great features, easy to use.","We bought 2 Samsung S7's. One of them has had problems just suddenly going to a black screen. We could hear the phone ringing & notifications coming in, but unable to respond, with no visual. This has happened 3-4 times in the past 2 1/2 weeks I have had it. We called Verizon support & found out what to do. Apparently, after looking online, we found that some of the S7's do have this problem, it wasn't just ours. The phone itself is amazing. Lots of features that didn't take too long to learn how to use. Camera & audio are fantastic. Battery life is really good. The screen does seem extra sensitive. We put a Zagg glass screen protector on one, but still sensitive. One of my game apps won't pull up sometimes. I have to restart phone. That is the only app I seem to have trouble with with the new phone.",2016-05-04T11:30:5,mabandbab
Galaxy-s7,Beautiful design with great productivity!,"We upgraded both of our Samsung Galaxy S3 phones and we are very pleased with the new S7 phones. Just a couple of problems, so far. The screens are so sensitive so we spend a lot of time hitting the back button and starting over. And, then there is the issue of all of the preloaded apps. Many of them I would not be inclined to download otherwise, since I have no use for them. And, on top of having all of the unwanted apps, they are constantly updating themselves and I can find no way to keep them from automatically updating or to uninstall (most of) them. Other than that, we love them!",2016-05-03T15:16:4,woof41
Galaxy-s7,SAMSUNG S7,"Overall I like the phone, camera is great and reasonably easy to set up but a short set up flyer would be really nice. Seems like a good quality phone with great screen and I like that it is water resistant. I did buy a protective case as well. My biggest complaint - as others have posted- is that the antenna on this phone is really subpar. My reception is cut in half and now only part of my house is usable whereas before no problems throughout the house with my old phone, same story at work-- get a few feet from a large outside window and off goes the phone and call. So samsung you need to design a much better antenna for this in your next upgrade-- otherwise, so far, am pleased with the phone.",2016-04-29T19:54:5,Jneal

Galaxy-s7,Problems reading the SD card correctly,Mostly like the Galaxy 7. Going to this one from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I like the smaller size and the keyboard is very responsive. Camera takes good pictures. It does eat battery just sitting overnight even when all the apps are closed and notifications cleared. Fortunately the quick charger truly is quick. One problem that I have not solved; the phone is not reading my SD card correctly. I put in a brand new unopened 64 GB card (SanDisk). Portable storage says I have 1.56 GB used of !.89 GB. I realized this after taking a few pictures and the camera said storage was full. I was given a suggestion about how to fix this but it didn't work for me. Any ideas out there would be appreciated,2016-04-25T02:19:2,Ella60

I usually don't get new phones unless my old phone is totally not working, but I didn't want to pass up on the deal that was being offered. I previously had the S4 so I can't compared to the later versions ie S5 & S6. There are some features that I wish it had like on the S4 unless I just haven't found it yet. The best feature to me is the camera. The clarity on the screen is awesome. However, I do keep getting an error message that the Samsung Link is malfunctioning. Don't know what to do about that. Customer Support here I come. All in all this is a great phone so far.",2016-04-20T19:43:2,KUhombre

Galaxy-s7,Overall very intuitive to use,"I got the S7 when switching from another carrier because my Xperia Z3 wasn't compatible with Verizon. I've had Samsung phones before and they were nice but they kept falling apart after a while so I hope they fixed those issues with the S7. The only thing keeping this review from being 5 stars is the battery life. With the Z3 I would be able to go several days on one charge without ever turning on power saver or another feature. I hardly use my phone throughout the day and it still decreases significantly. The messaging is also a little irksome because they don't have one default text messaging app, rather they let you choose between two of them which I thought was rather unnecessary.\n\nOther than that, the phone is very easy to use, reliable, fingerprint detection works well, the cameras are amazing (both front facing and back), it's customizable but not overwhelming. I'm pretty happy with my choice! I would have gone with the S7 edge but there were small features on the phone I didn't care too much about and it seemed to make handling the phone a bit more complicated so I stuck to what I thought was simpler. I'd recommend this phone to others looking for a reliable android that they can get the hang of quickly.",2016-04-20T18:25:5,ac1962
Galaxy-s7,Easiest transition! Minimal learning curve from s5,"This phone is great! The only issue I'm having is the curved edge and it's not even the s7 edge! My thumb pad of my palm keeps hitting keys and apps in that corner that mess up whatever it is I'm trying to do, most often type. Also, I have a new keyboard which is also annoying. However, overall as someone who hates change and hates getting a new phone rid this process has been pretty seamless :-)",2016-04-19T20:10:5,Easy peasy
Galaxy-s7,"Great phone, managing battery life should be way easier.","The good:\n- Replacing an older Galaxy S4, it's night and day better just for the ability to have more apps installed and faster processor.\n- Love the fingerprint unlock for the phone and especially LastPass!\n- The split screen is also very easy to use compared to the S4.\n- Always On screen is great to use when you are waiting for a response.\n- The camera is amazing for lower light photos.\n- Android Pay is easy to use and faster/safer than a credit card.\n\nWhat could be better:\nOut of the box, all the cool toys are turned on, which drains the battery fast.\nThe trick is to learning how to manage usage:\n- Disabling built-in apps that you don't need\n- Turning off features that are power hungry\n- Configuring power saver and ultra powersaver to further manage remaining juice\n- Accepting that an external battery is essential to have security that your device will make it through a full day away from a charger (Costco gave me one for free)\n\nWhat drives me nuts:\n- Why make a phone so slim and slippery that you need to buy a case that makes it more secure and easier to hold?

A few glitches here and there (some of the keys on the edge of screen <eg. P, L, Q, A> need to be hit a few times); the battery isn't as great as I had hoped (but the Fast Charge makes up for that).

I was freaked out but I did a normal reset on my phone and got back onto it immediately. Also, the battery life is nothing to speak about and I think I must charge it at least twice a day, but I use it for all sorts of things such as a visual schedule and alarm clock (I'm a special ed. teacher in a sensory classroom) and I also use the memo to write my ledger for my budget and things.

Galaxy-s7,Great Android Phone,"After two weeks with this phone, I am finding it more comfortable to use, as my business phone. Decided to go with this phone, as opposed to iPhone due to the opportunity to expand storage, via SD card. Battery life is ok, while not as good as my personal iPhone 6.

Galaxy-s7,Upgrade from S5,"Great pictures, very clear\nHave been a bit disappointed in the battery life. Lasts about 5 to 6 hours which was about what my S5 lasted. The fast charge is definitely a bonus and works better than my previous fast charger. About 20 minutes from 46% to 100%.\nWas having disconnection issues with WiFi but since the last upgrade this seems to have improved.\nI moved my 64 G card over from my old phone so all pics and files came with.

I can also tell a difference in the display on my games. It has better, sharper colors. My only gripe would be the so called bigger/better battery. It last about as long as the s5 did in power saving mode. Under moderate use I have to charge it ain the afternoons. But still better than an iphone.",2016-03-30T20:49:5,scott8875

Galaxy-s7,"So far, so good","I loved my S5, but I accidentally melted it so was forced into upgrading. Figured if I was going to get a new one, may as well go with newest technology. I'm still learning about some of the features, and there are some I'll never use. It has a nice feel to it, & I hated to add a case to it, adds weight, but I also don't want to ruin another phone. The doubled up locking feature is very annoying, since I use the phone as am alarm, but there may be a way around that that I haven't figured out yet. It's fast, the display is clear, the speaker is tinny but louder. I still haven't figured out how to access & play my music, and don't understand why my voicemail files show up in my music file (anybody have an answer to that?), but my biggest gripe is the battery life. All the pro reviews raved about a super long battery life & so-called fast charge, but this thing eats battery like crazy, even with a lot of hoggy apps turned off, and it doesn't charge any faster than my S5. Another couple weeks of use & I should have a better opinion. I like this phone, but I don't love it ....yet.",2016-03-30T16:13:1,Kimbpaul

Galaxy-s7,Best Galaxy yet!!,"The ease of use (as an android user) is appreciated, however, if someone is not used to the OS then it might be a little more taxing on the set up process.

Great camera improvements including rapid shooting, resolution, video, etc. External storage port is heaven to have again.\n\nNow the BUMMER: This phone does not see any of my bluetooth headsets, at all. I am an avid podcast user while running and hiking. My Old Galaxy S4 saw each of my 3 bluetooth headsets, each from different manufacturers and all relatively new but the GS7 doesn't. I have scoured the web for a solution, tried everything even remotely related to posted GS7 BT problems but no luck. I am so bummed and can only hope it gets fixed in an update.

I'm not sure if this is standard for this manufacturer or not. I verified that it is mostly the OS that is using up the battery, not apps.

Galaxy-s7,Impressive phone,"I finally decided to upgrade from having a Galaxy S3, to the new S7. This phone has awesome features including: pretty good battery life (assuming you install a 3rd party app killer & manage your apps accordingly,) an EXCELLENT camera, & beautiful display, good call quality, more functional voice controls, an ultra power saving mode which comes in handy when battery life is getting low, external storage (up to a 200 gig micro SD card) & water resistance.\n\nOn the down side I've noticed that the screen sometimes doesn't initially respond when you attempt to select something & as a result you have to tap it twice (I noticed this prior to adding a tempered glass screen protector.) The finger print reader usually registers, but will fail almost all the time if your finger is even the slightest bit wet. I've also noticed that certain email apps fail to deliver push notifications (mainly the Yahoo mail app & after trying quite a few things including clearing the phone's cache & clearing the cache on the app, the only way I've gotten it to work again before it decides to fail again, is to completely uninstall it & then install it again.)\n\nOver all I've very pleased with this latest Samsung phone & I'm very glad to have purchased it.",2016-03-29T18:14:2,gchildjr
Galaxy-s7,"Great so far, with one serious concern","After two weeks of using this great phone, the screen went black. The phone was still on but the screen stayed off. I checked the Verizon website and found a soft reboot procedure which started the phone again with the screen working as usual. Other than that negative incident, I would say that this is the best Samsung Galaxy that I have owned. The features are intuitive, the screen is clear and has GREAT definition, the camera has worked flawlessly, and the touch screen is amazing. When other people ask to see my phone, the most often compliments are how great the screen definition is, how light the phone is, and how the screen responds to touch.",2016-03-29T18:03:1,ChrisL66

Galaxy-s7,Much improved since the S4!,"I went from a Galaxy S4 to an S7 with Verizon's new upgrade program. I really like how I upgraded my phone, went into the new plan, and reduced my phone bill without paying a huge upfront cost for the phone. Very nice for consumers and makes me want to stay with Verizon.\n\nI love the S7. Super smooth. The camera is by far most noticeably improved from the S4. Clean images and ability to edit.\n\nOperating system allows for quick app. startup and processing. Buttons have quicker response time.\n\nThe ONLY reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because of the removable battery. The S7 is solid state, unmovable battery. This is a problem when/if the phone freezes. Also, in the event someone would want to carry a backup battery for long trips.",2016-03-29T17:47:3,TomMcGinniss

Galaxy-s7,Works as good as my S4 before Lollypop,I like the phone. However I wouldn't have upgraded from my S4 if Verizon hadn't forced Lollypop on me. It degraded my S4 to a feature phone.

Galaxy-s7,Phablet to Smartphone,"I picked this phone up a couple of days ago. So far I am enjoying it and its features. The double tap on the home button to open up the Camera is a nice touch to catch those precious moments of your children that come and go so quickly. The screen is bright and clear. The touch screen feels very accurate and even though this phone is smaller than the Note3 I came from it is easier to text on. There are however a few things I may change with this phone or phones to come out in the future. The S7's design is elegant and smooth, but, with this smoothness comes a con. If your hands have any sort of moisture or natural skin oil on them this thing feels like it will slip right out of your hand. I highly recommend a case (who doesn't buy one?). The other con I have is the battery life. This is probably due to the fact I came from the Note3 and it has a much larger battery capacity. I was literally watching the battery go down with light usage, the power saver feature on and the screen brightness as low as I could have it and still make out what is was on it (I closed all backround apps). I hope in the future phones get thicker to help support larger batteries and to fit better in your hand.",2016-03-28T15:40:0,IGJoe2192
Galaxy-s7,Everything but battery,I love how crisp and vivid the screen is. I love that i can put in a micro sd card and expand my storage. I love how lighting fast the phone is all around the phone is amazing. The only eye sore for me is the battery. I will pull phone off charger and the battery literary melts away. I use my phone lightly at most i run spotfy while at work which i understand can kill a battery. When im at home and i want to check Facebook for two mins the battery drops very fast it makes my head spin how fast it drains even in power save mode.,2016-03-28T11:07:2,JakeOclair85
Galaxy-s7,Great Phone with minor disadvantages,"I upgraded to this phone from a S4. This was a major upgrade even though I lost the removable battery and IR blaster, I kept microSD card support and gained water resistance. One thing that I don't like is the level of difficulty involved in repair of items that could fail on the phone (ie. battery, screen, charging port, etc). I personally repaired the screen on my S4 at least 4 times including the digitizer as well one time. This is much more difficult on the S7. The battery life on this phone hasn't impressed me yet either. The phone has always made it through the day for me, but sometimes it will barely make it to 9:30 or 10 PM. From the battery stats screen, android system and android OS are the culprits with the most battery usage, which tells me that perhaps a software upgrade could improve battery life. The screen colors look great, the camera comes up quick and focuses even quicker, Samsung pay works well, I love being able to take the phone in the shower and listen to music, the always on display works well and is handy, performance and multitasking works very well, and call quality is top notch (especially HD voice). All in all, I'm happy with this phone, I know that no phone is perfect, and I think this is the best phone on the market currently which is why I chose to upgrade from my trusty S4!",2016-03-25T11:49:2,projectrang
Galaxy-s7,Rough Start,"I absolutely love the phone, it is amazing. I think it's a great device. It's very fast, and the features are way better than the iPhone or Galaxy S6. The only problem I am having with it is the battery drains pretty quick (at least on my end), and I use my phone moderately. I do not play games on my phone, but the one game I have runs fine on it. The other problem I am having with it is that the internet will constantly disconnect and reconnect - regardless of if I am connected to WIFI or cellular. I think it's a glitch in the software Samsung may be fixing. Other than that, it's a great phone.",2016-03-21T13:09:0,mjr0729
Galaxy-s7,"Beautiful, fast, fun but battery life nowhere near what was reported","I have had my phone for 4 days now and love it in all aspects but one - the battery life, which was one of the main reasons I selected this phone so I am extremely disappointed. At first I thought it needed a full drain and then a charge but I've done that and still see poor results: 6 hours of being unplugged (at 100%) and used mildly while at work resulted in 46% battery life. That is exactly what I was seeing with my two year old Droid ultra that was known for notoriously poor battery life. \r\nOtherwise it is a beautiful, responsive, impressive phone. Have not taken any photos yet but viewed the camera and the image on screen looked nice. I read the complaints about bloat ware before I purchased but was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't anywhere near as bad as I was expecting - only a handful of programs that I didn't have on my old phone and that I needed to uninstall. \r\n\r\nIf it weren't for the battery life this would be a perfect phone.

The screen is great (minus the lag time with manufacturers of screen protectors getting their act together to cover the curved edges of the screen, but that's not the phone's fault), hardware is great and it operates very smoothly. Camera is also very good from the few tests I've done in the past week, and I love the microSD card slot. My only gripe is the battery. Maybe I had my expectations set too high before I got the phone but it doesn't seem to be holding a charge like a brand-new battery with this capacity should. \r\n\r\nMy older phone was a little over 2 years old and had a 2300mAh battery (HTC One M7). On a daily basis I use my phone at work minimally - check email a few times, browse the internet at lunch, etc. and maybe a few texts, but that's it. No gaming, no extensive browsing or app usage. I even hibernate apps I'm not using to save battery. My old phone would hit about 50% battery at lunch time and around 2:00pm I'd have to charge it so it wouldn't die before the end of the day. I expected that from an old phone with a smaller (by today's standards) battery. \r\n\r\nThe new S7 has a 3000mAh battery, should hold a charge like a new battery, and is using a newer version of Android which is supposed to be \",2016-03-15T15:10:1,JthePlantman

It was easy to set up and transfer my info (except that a few contacts didn't transfer for some reason.) My only real issue is that the Bluetooth cuts out and is distorted. I stream Amazon Prime Music from my S5 to a wireless speaker in my office everyday. With the S7 the connection shuts off after 1 or 2 songs. Sometimes it speeds up, slows down or buffers as well.

Galaxy-s7,Came from LG G4... underwhelmed!,"Firstly, my expectations may have been high since it was among the top 3 phones available at the time.  I was struck by the poor quality of the camera especially since it was touted as one of the best.  I actually thought I must've  had a plastic film over my camera to protect it in transit.  It did not.  I took several side by side shots with the g4 and s7 and the g4 seemed much more detailed.  The s7 was better in low light by far!  Also the s7 was faster... much faster!  I was disappointed in the swipe function on my eBay app which only seemed to work when it wanted to.  I also noticed that this phone seemed to be designed to be held in the left hand.  I hold mine right handed and find the button location irritating.  I also find the edges of the screen to be very sensitive to unwanted touch just from holding the phone my fingers would make contact with the slightly curved edges.  I will say to its benefit the WiFi works incredibly!  My g4 suffered from terrible WiFi connectivity!  This may be the only reason I haven't returned this device.  My g4 stopped working for no apparent reason and that was the only reason for the upgrade.  I will be waiting for a better phone to release and will be trading this in asap!",2017-01-22T20:45:3,Mdubya1

If I talk  on it for more than 45 minutes  during the day I will have to charge it when I get home at 6 PM. It does offer quick charging which is nice but I would've preferred 4000 mA  battery instead of the 3000 mA installed in the thing. The Motorola phone was an upgrade from an HTC,  which was pretty lousy. I guess I expected more  from the galaxy  instead it feels like a lateral move.

I bought the Samsung, because LG ditched all these features. The S7 also lacks these features and is only better in that it cable charges very fast. At least it can charge wirelessly, even though it's slower than the old LG. The new LGs cannot even charge wirelessly. The camera is supposed to be better, but I'll never notice a difference probably. The buttons are on the side where they are hard to reach instead of on the back like the G2. The new Android lacks a lot of the convenience of old Android: no media volume control in the drop-down, less customization in the drop-down, etc. It's just very disappointing that the latest and greatest is missing so many features and adds seemingly nothing.",2016-10-07T18:50:5,Shebon

If you read the reviews on all the screen protectors for the S7, all get poor reviews. They won't fit proper. My Zagg glass screen protector does not contact on the edges, it is a pain when trying to type and such, and dust is constantly under the protector edges. A case which encompasses the entire phone, such as a Otterbox Defender which I used for my S6, will not work well.

Galaxy-s7,Great phone except for battery,"I got this phone last week after reading lots of reviews and talking to friends that have it.  I had an older model Galaxy before my previous phone and I really liked it so I felt like it was a good decision to go back to the Galaxy.  I wish I would have believed almost every review that I read that talked about how bad the battery life is.  I don't feel that I use my phone much.  I don't stream music, I rarely watch videos and if I do they are less than 5 minutes, I check my email, text and use a few social media apps.  After 10 hours my battery is around 30%......with minimal use.  I hate having to carry a back up charger with me wherever I go.  It's not convenient and I know it will only get worse as the phone gets older.  If you need your phone to last all day and you actually use your phone, I wouldn't suggest this model.",2016-09-09T13:24:1,Mradams

Galaxy-s7,Having trouble,I just bought the Samsung S7 last week and half the time when I answer the phone I can't hear whoever is calling me and when I make calls they can't hear me or I can't hear them and there's a loud buzzing on the other end of the line. Took it to Verizon and we switch the SIM card and that didn't fix it so now I'm going to have to return it since I'm still in my 14 day window to return.,2016-09-03T14:06:4,Britt777

I am confused about why the S7 from Verizon won't play fm /am radio with an app, when it will for the other carrier's. This means I have to stream music and news or carry a separate radio to listen to the local stuff. I'm not sure if this is by design or an oversight?

Galaxy-s7,"Good, but not great. Didn't really live up to my expectations.","I recently replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 with the Galaxy S7 since my phone was eligible for an upgrade. I was excited to transition over to the S7 since I've heard so many good things about it. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed was that the audio for both media and calls sound a bit off compared to the S5. Not much I can say about it. You have the option to optimize the audio to your liking. Even after some tinkering, I really didn't think it made that much of a difference. \r\n\r\nAnother big thing I noticed was the battery life. I've had to charge my phone about three to five times in one day. Plus, it takes a very long time to charge even after claiming that it's supposed to charge relatively quickly. I started charging my phone at 47%, and an hour later, it's only at 52%. I feel like my S5 charged faster and lasted longer. \r\n\r\nOn the bright side, the picture and video quality is awesome. But for someone that streams a lot of videos on Twitch, YouTube, Netflix, and Hulu... I rely on long-lasting battery life and good audio. Again, not too impressed.",2016-08-17T23:01:5,negurl

You cheaped out with the minimally useful quick start guide that came with them. I found the complete manual online, but cannot print it out due to time, size, and cost constraints with regard to paper and toner. Very disappointing in that my husband and I have both been contacted by text message from a Samsung/BestBuy service rep They inquired if we were happy with our phones and our experience. I inquired about a manual. Although their original message indicated that we would be contacted within the next business day, I've yet to receive any response at all.

Because voice message notifications will not come through the phone connection or a WiFi connection.  I was told that only by having data turned on will I get notice that someone has left a phone message.  So when traveling overseas, unless you're wealthy and can buy a lot of data access, you won't ever know if you have voice mail unless you continuously dial in.  Why on earth did they change the voice mail system so that a phone connection alone is not enough, but you HAVE to have data turned on??",2016-08-05T22:26:5,VT123

There also seems to be a delay when not up close with perfect bright lighting between pressing the shutter button and the photo being taken.  Many functions seem very complicated, like just getting the photos from the device to the computer.  It is SO easy with every other device I have.  With others, you just plug in the USB cord and the computer recognizes it just as though it were a jump drive.  I still haven't figured out how to easily do it with the Samsung Galaxy S7.  I tried it with the Google Drive and that was a disaster.  It didn't download all the pictures, just some.  And, if there were pictures taken with the burst mode, it only downloaded one of the photos of the group.  Everything else has also been complicated to figure out.

Galaxy-s7,Not all I had expected..,"I had two Motorola phones that I loved. Unfortunately, within a year of using them they both began to break down. Within two years, they each stopped working all together. \r\nI picked up the new Samsung Galaxy s7 with the hope that it was a better piece of electronics. I've had the phone less than two weeks, and I'm not very happy. The battery wears down in half the time of the Motorola, and it doesn't have a few of the features I really loved the most in my previous two phones.. Yes, the Galaxy does have some cool features my Motorola did not have, but if I had to do it again, I would have picked out a third Motorola, even though the last two died after 18 months.. Only time will tell if this Galaxy last longer than the others..",2016-07-19T23:41:4,Bad Boys Bill

Has something to do with my yahoo security protocols. It tells me to use a different address but when I try to download it it tells me it is already on the phone but I cant find the programs or apps. Granted I am not use to a smart phone so I will just keep earning about it. Would be easier if there was a manual for it.

Galaxy-s7,Not what I expected,I had to purchase updated phone for work purposes and was advised to go Android since all other devices are Android.  Was told the Galaxy S7 would suit me better than the Edge--I didn't need all the Edge features.  My local store walked me through the basics and transferred all my contacts as a courtesy.   So far the battery life is less than expected - automatic updates go through it quickly and require mid-day recharges unless you know to schedule them when at home.  Am not used to having to manually have to close each app upon exiting - other devices do that automatically.  If you don't close them they add to the battery drain.  Also lost 6 favorite contacts one night when phone was not in use - no clue why.  Have had to re-input contacts since new system sorted them differently than original device - again no clue why.  Have no major complaints beyond battery life and expect I will appreciate features once I become more familiar with them.  Would recommend to someone experienced on smartphones but to a novice only with training.,2016-07-02T19:47:5,Smartphone novice

Why is this screen guard cracked in the upper right corner already? I haven't even dropped the phone! The battery life is NOT as impressive in duration as I thought, although it charges  faster. I do not like the limited volume. The location of the speaker makes it hard to hear the phone ring or audio play when the phone is face up on a flat surface. ...and why could I not choose a simple ring tone that actually sounds like a phone ring rather than an alarm tone or some music I may ignore? A few photos come out questionably blurred and retakes are always necessary in dim light indoors. I have not found the wow factor of this phone yet.  It seems basic.

Leave the battery saver off, and you will be charging it at lunch. This is just my first impression.

Galaxy-s7,OK,"devise tends to break up during phone calls and will lose connection, very frustrating",2016-06-16T00:09:1,khan11
Galaxy-s7,"moderate,","Moderate phone, fewer apps, and many apps don't want, but cannot get rid of. should be easy to get rid of apps I donot want.",2016-06-15T19:40:3,Phieding
Galaxy-s7,"Win Some, Lose Some","I wanted to upgrade mainly to replace my HTC One M8 running Windows 8.1 (since it won't upgrade to 10) for the Droid OS, and opted for this over the new HTC flagship. I did a ton of research. I love that it's IP68 rating, the camera and display are awesome. I use it in place of an older, small laptop to cruise Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter because it is quick. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, the battery life is underwhelming. I end up placing it on the charger everyday. If it's a day where I listen to music via my Bluetooth headphones, texting more than usual or have a couple of calls I'll go to bed with the battery at 35% of its capacity; I eek out 55% if I've just used it for music in the car and light usage during the day. The last thing of note, I'm not an audiophile... I do notice my old phone played music at higher quality.\r\n\r\nThere are other little things that irk me a little bit, but I don't know if it's an OS, App, or phone issue.",2016-06-13T22:19:1,dannyw
Galaxy-s7,"Some cool features, but just okay.","I've had the phone for almost a month. I like the IP68 waterproof rating and the LED screen is great. I'm not impressed by some of the basic functions of the software. The phone section could be a more user friendly. When I start spelling a contact name to call, it only suggests favorites or by alphabetical order. It doesn't suggest contacts that I call frequently. In the recent calls, I have select the # that I recently called and then select to call it. Why can't there be a call button next to the # under the recent calls? Why doesn't the Verizon S7 have FM radio capability? I thought the reception would be better than my LG G3, but it isn't. The only aspect of reception that is better, is that I can hold my S7 between my ear and shoulder and not lose signal like my G# would. Overall, the LG  software seemed more user friendly and stable. Speaker being located on the bottom makes the phone hard to hear when it's laying down.",2016-06-13T21:27:4,Susans phone
Galaxy-s7,Nice phone - not so nice transfer of data,Like the phone but not the way contacts transfer over and no text messages transferred over.,2016-06-13T15:22:1,Ryan80516
Galaxy-s7,Not much different from the note 4 except it has no IR blaster.,"I'm not too happy that I loose my IR blaster and I still can't find my voice to text option for my keyboard.  The phone is fast, but Imy not sure it was worth starting payments over again over my last phone.",2016-06-13T14:35:4,KarKar34
Galaxy-s7,Easier than an iPhone,I've had this phone for two weeks and it's easy to use and simple. That's why I like it.,2016-06-13T11:46:1,Javyespitia333

Galaxy-s7,Dissappointed,For the money it doesn't have a lot of the optionsame the s5 I had did and it seems less user friendly,2016-06-09T23:26:2,JLO2002
Galaxy-s7,Terrible Battery Life,"Some nice features on the phone itself, but very disappointing battery life on my device. I use it for roughly a TOTAL of 20 minutes each day while at work and by the time I get home it's at 20% IF I'M LUCKY. It seems that no amount of closing tasks helps.",2016-06-09T19:59:0,Lainiemags
Galaxy-s7,Somewhat disappointed,"I bought this last week and am disappointed in some of the features.   I need to charge it too often.  On most of my emails I only received the subject and not the body of the email,  doesn't download emails as they come in.  Plan to go back to Verizon store.   The salespeople are really helpful",2016-06-09T01:00:5,Bikerider54
Galaxy-s7,Next time I'll go back to my I-phone,"Have had trouble bringing up Pandora, and syncing the phone to other blue-tooth equip. The Siri equivalent takes about 10 seconds to answer... so I don't even use it.Otherwise, it's a nice phone",2016-06-08T20:58:5,Jenn7682
Galaxy-s7,It's ok,I have a lot of problems when making calls. Sometimes it tries to ring and hangs up immediately. Sometimes the people on the other end can't hear me. I have a hard time hearing them. Just a pain when I use that feature the most!,2016-06-07T19:08:0,williams516
Galaxy-s7,Samsung Galaxy s7,"I upgraded from the 5s to the 7s and somethings are better, but the wifi signal is not as good as the 5s. With my 5s I could walk to the mailbox and the wifi still works, with the 7s walking to the same distance the wifi would not pick up.",2016-06-07T18:56:0,fishyface
Galaxy-s7,Still can't decide,"I want to like this phone a lot more than I do. I love the new features, and I'm so happy that Samsung went back to SD storage after the S6 - not allowing SD was enough to make me move away from the Galaxy. But the phone itself doesn't seem to be that much better than the S5 I had before. I almost wish I'd just gotten another S5. It restarts itself in the middle of navigating me (has happened twice in the two weeks I've had the phone), which leaves me lost in traffic - not good when you're driving in a very large city. The fingerprint unlock feature is great, but you have to put your finger on at relatively the same angle every time or it won't work, so be aware of that. And if it restarts, you have to use the pin the first time before you can use fingerprints to unlock. The only reason I upgraded was that my S5 was 2 years old and the battery no longer lasted, but now I miss it. It's a good phone, but I don't think it's much more special. I guess the water resistant thing is nice, but I'm not the type to expose my phone to that much water anyways.",2016-06-07T17:35:0,Jobro

Galaxy-s7,"Nice phone, terrible battery life","I've had the phone for a couple weeks now and generally like the phone but the battery life is just awful. I unplug in the morning and before lunch it's down in the 40% range, and that's with no apps running, screen brightness turned down, etc. Super frustrated with that. It does charge fast but if I can't get through the day without my phone dying even when I'm barely using it, it's not a good situation. I don't really want to carry my charger around everywhere I go.",2016-06-06T23:21:5,Melnoel
Galaxy-s7,So so,Not as impressed as I should be. Traded in my S5 for the S7 & the battery life has been unimpressive. I was told I needed to turn off the location services for better battery life. I didn't have to do that on my S5. So far I haven't found anything about the S7 that has impressed me.,2016-06-06T04:45:4,Purplecat611

Galaxy-s7,"Lots of features but seeing that this is my first smart phone, it's difficult.",I've only had a smart phone for a week and this one seems to be a little hard to learn but I'm working on it. May take me a year to learn most of the features. It does have many lessons to learn. So far I like it.,2016-06-05T18:46:5,jcs27516
Galaxy-s7,OK not as good as my previous Note 4,"I bought this phone about a week ago and already notice that the battery life is not that great. I get about 10 hours use out of the battery using the phone normally. Also, the phone does not seem as fast as my previous Note 4 was.",2016-06-05T18:41:4,Michaelshain

Galaxy-s7,functionality became slow quickly,I purchased this phone about 1 month ago and it's already slow. The on button only works at times. The center button never scans your fingerprint accurately on the first try. Once it does it takes a few seconds before the phone actually unlocks. It drags.,2016-06-03T15:49:3,Jencas28

Galaxy-s7,Samsung 7 lots of good old programs left out/and or changed.,I am totally stressed out with this new phone because I am leaving the country in 3 days.  The representative took the easy way out and downloaded everything into the cloud and not onto my saved icons and places. I had to spend hours with Liz the tech rep. to help me get back to my Real Estate business. I am a Realtor not a telephone geek.  Thank God for Liz. My phone was always dying so Liz had to use a lot of tricks to get it all set up properly.\r\nNow I;m noticing that it is not charging and that I had some static last night on 2 calls.  \r\nI hope to get to the store ASAP to have Liz see whats going on with my brand new phone.,2016-06-02T19:17:2,parkerco27

Galaxy-s7,Hard transition from flip phone to smart phone,Since we changed from a flip phone to the smart phone it's been an uphill learning curve and not one that has been easy.   Don't really understand all the apps and even how to answer the phone is difficult.   Other than the 2/3rds that we still need to work on to use the phone properly its a good phone.    It will probably take us a longer while since we are not tech savy people.,2016-05-31T22:08:0,restfulrabbit
Galaxy-s7,"Fast phone, difficult to hold","The S7 is a gorgeous, fast phone. Its camera is phenomenal, the screen is bright and the battery life is fantastic. I appreciate features like double - tapping the home button for camera, but I dislike the always on display personally - - I find it distracting. \r\n\r\nHaving come from an LG G3, I find the phone difficult to use with one hand, since the buttons are located so far down on the device.  The phone constantly mutes itself in my pocket too, leading to missed calls and messages. I'm also surprised the screen scratches so easily; by the end of the first day with careful handling and before I could get a screen protector, the screen has received a couple scratches. Definitely get a screen protector on this device ASAP.",2016-05-31T21:16:4,Jweed14

Galaxy-s7,Remembered why I moved away from Samsung,"So I broke my Sony Xperia z3 and since it was xlose to end of my 2 year i went for a new phone. S7 looks gorgeous.  However, after I came home started actually using it, i remembered why I chose Sony last time. It gets hot. Less battery stamina (I am not doing anything crazy and have turned off battery suckered off). Also Sony 's UI/UX is much more friendly. For example when you go on your call list to return someone's call when you take on their number it does not dial, it shows you another screen where you need to click on dial or send a text. Imagine this while driving.  I also loved press and hold features of my previous phone. Now I understand why people say iPhone is more user friendly than Samsung. It's not Android it's Samsung.",2016-05-30T20:19:1,Charlene54
